# CWPK Modeling Results

The *Cooking with Python and KBpedia* series modeling results produce 
files that are generally too large for GitHub. As a result, you should be 
constructing most of the results files locally. Some files may also be 
referenced in individual **CWPK** installments for download from the 
KBpedia Web site.
