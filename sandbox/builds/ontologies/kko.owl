        <skos:editorialNote xml:lang="en">To our knowledge, KBpedia is the first knowledge representation usable by computers that attempts to embrace Peircean principles in all of its aspects. Being first also means little scrutinized. We hope other scholars of Charles Sanders Peirce (CSP, pronounced &quot;purse&quot;) contribute with their understandings.

The history of the KBpedia Knowledge Ontology (KKO) also shows periodic, big chunks of change. The ideas behind KKO are grand and encompassing. The writings of CSP are subtle and profound. Further, CSP&apos;s writings are still being transcribed and organized, and it is difficult to get what does exist in the literature in electronic form. The net result is sometimes new understandings and change in the upper KKO structure.

Any attempt to capture the ideas of Charles Sanders Peirce or to be guided by an understanding of his teachings is fraught with many difficulties. His views shifted over the years; he was not always in a position to completely explicate his views; and much of his writing still remains untranscribed. Such is the nature of facts trying to lead to truth.

We welcome input at any time about how best to capture Peircean ideas into a computable knowledge graph. Useful input will be readily acknowledged, including in future updates of the KBpedia Knowledge Ontolgy (KKO).

Peircean scholars have been the first source of information here. A good starting point is the entire Peirce category on Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Charles_Sanders_Peirce). There are speciality Peircean online sources too numerous to list that are also useful from these starting links.

Another resource is the Peirce online discussion list: http://www.iupui.edu/~arisbe/PEIRCE-L/PEIRCE-L.HTM.</skos:editorialNote>
        <skos:editorialNote xml:lang="en">In KKO, &apos;CSP&apos; is a shorthand for Charles Sanders Peirce (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce), whose writings have had a great influence on the design of this knowledge graph. 

Also, some CSP quotes are derived from the following sources:

CP x.y =Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, volume x, paragraph y.

        <owl:priorVersion xml:lang="en">Version 1.10 of KKO and KBpedia, released Nov 15, 2016, focused on two major updates. First, certain aspects of the upper structure of KKO were streamlined. And, second, KBpedia’s core typologies, which capture the overwhelming majority of reference concepts that are classified as entity types, were further organized to create tighter taxonomic structures.</owl:priorVersion>
        <owl:priorVersion xml:lang="en">Version 1.00 of the KBpedia Knowledge Ontology (KKO), released Aug 6, 2016, was the first commercial release of the system. It was a rather complete re-write and re-organization of the UMBEL (Upper Mapping and Binding Exchange Layer) ontology, significantly modified to accommodate its purpose for integrating knowledge bases (KBs).</owl:priorVersion>
        <dc:description xml:lang="en">The KBpedia Knowledge Ontology (KKO) is a foundational ontology for capturing the essential components (or &apos;primitives&apos;) of knowledge bases. It is an amalgam of seven of the largest public knowledge bases available -- Wikipedia, DBpedia, Wikidata, GeoNames, OpenCyc, schema.org, and the UN Standard Products and Services Code (UNSPSC). It is designed for mapping and interoperating diverse ontologies to one another. The ultimate objective of KKO is to provide an ontology that surfaces and organizes the features within knowledge bases most useful to machine learning, artificial intelligence, data interoperability, schema mapping, and fact tagging and extraction.

The design of the KBpedia Knowledge Ontology is informed by the semiotics (theory of signs) articulated by the 19th century American logician, Charles Sanders Peirce. The design is based on the triadic ideas of Firstness, Secondness and Thirdness that informed virtually all of Peirce&apos;s formulations in logic and philosophy. 

Peirce&apos;s theory of signs reflects a continual process of the understanding of what a sign means evolving through truth-testing and community use and consensus. The ultimate basis of a sign resides in the idea or quality of something (a Firstness), which has a monadic relationship to itself; an object which is described or made evident in relation to these qualities through dyadic relationships (a Secondness); and then which is understood or perceived by an interpretant (a Thirdness), such as an intelligent human being. (Though in broadest terms, semiosis is not limited to human mediation, and may apply to other agents, such as artificial intelligence.) All signs embody all three of these triadic aspects.

Signs build upon signs -- such is the case with human languages and the concepts conveyed by them -- and ultimately are subject to logic and questioning, the results of which may cause the nature of the relationships between these aspects of signs to undergo revision and refinement. Semiosis is thus intimately related to logic and is itself a continuous and community-oriented process.

Words and language are themselves a Thirdness, which is the result of signmaking consensus. The semiotic or signmaking process builds from things as they are or may be to an ability to name and describe them though language -- and then ultimately to reason and argue over them leading to shared understandings, laws and complex notions of human concepts and worldviews. Each successive progression of signs involves this interplay of requisite Firstness, Secondness and Thirdness. This triadic nature of signs provides a coherent way to understand and organize the representation of knowledge at any level.</dc:description>
        <owl:priorVersion xml:lang="en">Version 1.40 of the KBpedia Knowledge Ontology (KKO) and KBpedia, released Feb 28, 2017, was the result of reciprocal mapping from Wikipedia to KBpedia. Reciprocal mapping adds sub-graph structure and new nodes to the target knowledge base. Nearly 40% more reference concepts were added to KBpedia in this v 1.40 release compared to prior versions of KBpedia.</owl:priorVersion>
        <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The KBpedia Knowledge Ontology (KKO) is a foundational ontology for capturing the essential components (or &apos;primitives&apos;) of knowledge bases.

        <owl:priorVersion xml:lang="en">Version 2.21 of KKO and KBpedia was updated Dec 7, 2019, with minor placement improvements from the original v 2.20, released Nov 11, 2019. This version was devoted to clean up of the individual typologies in the system, the removal of long species lists and individuals, some re-organization of the results, and removal of UMBEL linkages due to the retirement of that system. Nearly 2000 reference concepts (RCs) were removed from KBpedia due to these changes.</owl:priorVersion>
        <owl:priorVersion xml:lang="en">Version 2.00 of KBpedia and KKO, released Jan 23, 2019, provided full mappings to Wikidata and Wikipedia, as well as complete definitions for all RCs (reference concepts). Duplicates were checked and many minor typology corrections were made. This version was the first, complete, open-source release of KBpedia. Because of these substantial changes, the version numbers were skipped forward.</owl:priorVersion>
        <owl:priorVersion xml:lang="en">Version 1.50 of KKO and KBpedia, released Sep 13, 2017, marked a major update. KKO properties were updated and organized according the three main property splits into Attributes, (external) Relations, and Representations (or Annotations) according to Peircean principles and the universal categories of Firstness, Secondness and Thirdness. Version 1.50 also used this structure to introduce a comprehensive mapping against Wikidata properties.</owl:priorVersion>
        <owl:versionInfo xml:lang="en">Version 2.50 of KKO and KBpedia, released Feb 10, 2020, is another major upgrade that resulted in version numbers skipping forward. The major change in this version is to completely integrate the UN Standard Products and Services Codes (UNSPSC) as the seventh core knowledge base included in the system, joining Wikidata, Wikipedia, OpenCyc, schema.org, GeoNames, and DBpedia. This addition now brings ecommerce and marketing capabilities to KBpedia. The Products typology was split into three parts and better disjointedness tests were added to the system. 

The addition of UNSPSC added a net of about 5000 reference concepts (RCs) to the system, including identification and removal of about 700 duplicate RCs from the merge. (Total RCs now exceed 58 K.) Mappings to Wikidata and Wikipedia were also made for this new UNSPSC structure, which now contains all three levels of the four-level UNSPSC structure, as well as thousands of the &apos;commodity&apos; level items in it. 

Property mappings to UNSPSC, Wikidata, Wikipedia, and GeoNames, while previously available in separate mapping files, were also added to the base KBpedia system. Note that these KBpedia mappings are still available as separate files.</owl:versionInfo>
        <owl:priorVersion xml:lang="en">Version 1.20 of the KBpedia Knowledge Ontology (KKO) and KBpedia, released Dec 5, 2016, was a fairly significant re-write of the KKO upper structure. This update was driven by two factors: 1) a revisiting of some assignments due to the attention given actions and predicates (specifically, Actions, Events, Situations, Relations) as opposed to earlier efforts that focused on Entities and Classes (Generals); and 2) an attempt to both rely more directly on Peircean terminology where it made sense and to rely less directly on that terminology where it was obscure or dated.</owl:priorVersion>

        <owl:priorVersion xml:lang="en">Version 1.60 of KKO and KBpedia, released Oct 1, 2018, marked the first open-source version of KBpedia. It greatly expanded mappings to Wikidata and Wikipedia and moved to address gaps in the definitions of resource concepts (RCs). However, because of time pressures, not all open-source updates were completed for this release.</owl:priorVersion>
        <skos:altLabel xml:lang="en">KBpedia</skos:altLabel>
        <owl:priorVersion xml:lang="en">Version 2.10, released Mar 27, 2019, resulted in instance mappings for Wikidata achieving 99% coverage. All 45 K mappings were manually checked, resulting in a further 1.25% correction of assignments. About half of existing mappings to Wikidata categories were converted to be represented by the topic entity. Wikipedia mappings have been similarly improved.</owl:priorVersion>
        <owl:priorVersion xml:lang="en">Version 1.30 of KKO, released on Jan 27, 2017, was an internal release version only. This version tested procedures for reverse mapping of sub-graph structures within a source knowledge base (B) to those of the target KBpedia knowledge structure (A). Most conventional mappings are of the B --&gt; A form, where what is mapped from B requires a direct tie-in point in A. Reverse mapping, tentatively called reciprocal mapping, identifies and places new structure from B into A, resulting in the target now being (B+A).</owl:priorVersion>

This property is not intended as a general expression of similarity, but rather the likely but uncertain same identity of the two resources being related.

This property can and should be changed if the certainty of the sameness of identity is subsequently determined.

In general, we may not be able to assert that two individuals are the same based solely on current information on hand. However, there may be quite reasonable bases or methods that the two individuals are likely the same without being one hundred percent sure.

kko:isLike has the semantics of likely identity, but where there is some uncertainty that the two resources indeed refer to the exact same individual with the same identity. Such uncertainty can arise when, for example, common names may be used for different individuals (e.g., John Smith).

It is appropriate to use this property when there is strong belief the two resources refer to the same individual with the same identity, but that association can not be asserted at the present time with certitude. </skos:definition>

Associatives are the juxtaposition of a different thing to a given thing to indicate a relationship of some nature. Associatives must be between two or more objects. Since the degree of association can not be defined, no inference can be made about associations. Sameness or being a member of the same type is specifically excluded from this definition

As an &quot;indecomposable,&quot; this category should be understood as the potential or possibility of this monad and not representative of the actual thing.</skos:definition>

        <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Concepts are ideas and mediated combinations of ideas that reflect more abstract or generalized thoughts than the typing or natural classing of objects, the focus of most other supertypes. 

Concepts are non-disjoint with all other supertypes.</skos:definition>
        <skos:editorialNote xml:lang="en">As defined in KKO, concepts are NOT entities, but may be entity types. Concepts are the most abstract treatment of particulars and types, and are organized not by logically determinable semiosis, but by &quot;worldviews&quot; that provide a coherent, but not necessarily decomposable, organization of ideas.

Concepts are organized into schema, which have a kind of hierarchical or taxonomic backbone of sorts, but are ultimately graphs. (Not sure here, but the typologies used for organizing entities are strictly taxonomic, I think.)

Concept structures are most often what is seen in current ontologies, both those of the upper and domain variety.

How we go about constructing the concept schema, let alone whether there will only be a single one or perhaps 2-3, remains to be determined. The basic ideas at present for the first schema are all based on &quot;bridging from&quot; or leveraging an existing schema. Possible source schema include:

1) the upper structure of OpenCyc, absent many abstract concepts, entities and entity types
2) an existing organizational structure from Wikipedia. Individual candidates include:
-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Main_topic_classifications
-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Fundamental_categories
3) another existing upper ontology, though all I have inspected seemed flawed (as does now OpenCyc to me)
4) an existing KOS system in widespread use, such as UDC, or LCSH (Library of Congress) (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Classification)
5) some other internal means based on residual RCs with some unknown method.

This general topic should also address the questions of Rules, Domains, Schema, and Worldviews.</skos:editorialNote>

The most common logical connectives are binary connectives (also called dyadic connectives) which join two sentences which can be thought of as the function&apos;s operands. Also commonly, negation is considered to be a unary connective.

Logical connectives along with quantifiers are the two main types of logical constants used in formal systems such as propositional logic and predicate logic. Semantics of a logical connective is often, but not always, presented as a truth function.

A logical relation is part of a formal system (together with defined semantics) in the form of model-theoretic interpretation that assigns truth values to sentences of the formal language; that is, formulae that contain no free variables. A logic is sound if all sentences that can be derived are true in the interpretation, and complete if, conversely, all true sentences can be derived.

A logical connective is similar to but not equivalent to a conditional operator.

        <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Knowledge emergence is the result of a process (the methodeutic) whereby new complex entities, principals of the real world, or discovery of new insights are made. The new knowledge so discovered then requires inspection for how it fits and interacts with the world, oft resulting in the emergence of new domains for inquiry. 

Knowledge may also emerge when existing assumptions are tested and found to be incorrect. Thus, knowledge is always emerging and our understanding of the world is always fallible. But the discovery and the emergence of new knowledge is always available to any domain of inquiry.

Emergence is central in theories of integrative levels and of complex systems. For instance, the phenomenon of life as studied in biology is an emergent property of chemistry and psychological phenomena emerge from the neurobiological phenomena of living things. Likewise, economic and legal phenomena emerge from psychology.

In philosophy, emergence typically refers to emergentism. Almost all accounts of emergentism include a form of epistemic or ontological irreducibility to the lower levels. In the Peircean sense, the basis for emergence rests in the logic of semiosis and the triadic categories of Firstness, Secondness and Thirdness.</skos:definition>

Events begin in an instant and may be no longer than that, or may continue through many instants and still retain an event identity. Thus, events may have duration. Also, thoughts are events. Without events, there are no entities.

Events may have a finite duration, with a beginning and end. Individual events (such as wars, disasters, newsworthy occasions) may also have their own names.

Events are demarcated by a change, or a difference in state (that is, qualities). A change may occur by chance, by exertion, by perception, or any other action.</skos:definition>
        <skos:editorialNote xml:lang="en">From 5.284: &quot;. . . there is no intuition or cognition not determined by previous cognitions, it follows that the striking in of a new experience is never an instantaneous affair, but is an event occupying time, and coming to pass by a continuous process.&quot;</skos:editorialNote>
        <skos:editorialNote xml:lang="en">From CP 1.132: &quot;. . . every event is precisely determined by general laws, which evidently never can be rendered probable by observation, and which, if admitted, must, therefore, stand as self-evident.&quot;</skos:editorialNote>
        <skos:editorialNote xml:lang="en">From CP 1.24: &quot;Let us begin with considering actuality, and try to make out just what it consists in. If I ask you what the actuality of an event consists in, you will tell me that it consists in its happening then and there. The specifications then and there involve all its relations to other existents. The actuality of the event seems to lie in its relations to the universe of existents. . . . Actuality is something brute. There is no reason in it. I instance putting your shoulder against a door and trying to force it open against an unseen, silent, and unknown resistance. We have a two-sided consciousness of effort and resistance, which seems to me to come tolerably near to a pure sense of actuality. On the whole, I think we have here a mode of being of one thing which consists in how a second object is. I call that Secondness.&quot;</skos:editorialNote>
        <skos:editorialNote xml:lang="en">From CP 1.336: &quot;We perceive objects brought before us; but that which we especially experience -- the kind of thing to which the word &quot;experience&quot; is more particularly applied -- is an event. We cannot accurately be said to perceive events; for this requires what Kant called the &quot;synthesis of apprehension,&quot; not however, by any means, making the needful discriminations. A whistling locomotive passes at high speed close beside me. As it passes the note of the whistle is suddenly lowered from a well-understood cause. I perceive the whistle, if you will. I have, at any rate, a sensation of it. But I cannot be said to have a sensation of the change of note. I have a sensation of the lower note. But the cognition of the change is of a more intellectual kind. That I experience rather than perceive. It is [the] special field of experience to acquaint us with events, with changes of perception. Now that which particularly characterizes sudden changes of perception is a shock. A shock is a volitional phenomenon.&quot;</skos:editorialNote>
        <skos:editorialNote xml:lang="en">From CP 1.492: &quot;It is, in the first place, only real events that &quot;take place,&quot; or have dates, in real time. Imaginary events, the course of a romance, are represented as having relations like those of time among one another, but they have no real places in time. . . . What, then, is a real event? It is an existential junction of incompossible facts.&quot;

See further CP 1.492 - 1.494.</skos:editorialNote>
        <skos:editorialNote xml:lang="en">From CP 1.493: &quot;In general, however, we may say that for an event there is requisite: first, a contradiction; second, existential embodiments of these contradictory states; [third,] an immediate existential junction of these two contradictory existential embodiments or facts, so that the subjects are existentially identical; and fourth, in this existential junction a definite one of the two facts must be existentially first in the order of evolution and existentially second in the order of involution. We say the former is earlier, the latter later in time. That is, the past can in some measure work upon and influence (or flow into) the future, but the future cannot in the least work upon the past. On the other hand, the future can remember and know the past, but the past can only know the future so far as it can imagine the process by which the future is to be influenced.&quot;</skos:editorialNote>
        <skos:editorialNote xml:lang="en">From CP 5.472: &quot;An event, A, may, by brute force, produce an event, B; and then the event, B, may in its turn produce a third event, C. The fact that the event, C, is about to be produced by B has no influence at all upon the production of B by A. It is impossible that it should, since the action of B in producing C is a contingent future event at the time B is produced. Such is dyadic action, which is so called because each step of it concerns a pair of objects.&quot;</skos:editorialNote>

All can be geospatially located.

Facilities also include animal pens and enclosures and general human &quot;activity&quot; areas (golf course, archeology sites, etc.). Iportantly Facilities include infrastructure systems such as roadways and physical networks.

Facilities also include the component parts that go into making them (such as foundations, doors, windows, roofs, etc.) 

Facilities can also include natural structures that have been converted or used for human activities, such as occupied caves or agricultural facilities.

Finally, facilities also include workplaces. Workplaces are areas of human activities, ranging from single person workstations to large aggregations of people (but which are not formal political entities)</skos:definition>

        <skos:definition xml:lang="en">First monads are &quot;indecomposable&quot; elements that capture the quality (suchness), haecceity (thisness) or pluralness of things. Like all monads, they are possibles or potentials, and not actually realized in any way. They are the possible ways that particulars and generals might be understood in and of themselves, in isolation without respect to any other or contrast.

Like its alternate label, first monads are similar to ontic (from the Greek ὄν, genitive ὄντος: &quot;of that which is&quot;), relating to the physical, real, or factual existence. Ontic describes what is there, as opposed to the nature or properties of that being.</skos:definition>

        <skos:editorialNote xml:lang="en">From CP 1.303: &quot;The pure idea of a monad is not that of an object. For an object is over against me. But it is much nearer an object than it is to a conception of self, which is still more complex. There must be some determination, or suchness, otherwise we shall think nothing at all. But it must not be an abstract suchness, for that has reference to a special suchness. It must be a special suchness with some degree of determination, not, however, thought as more or less. There is to be no comparison. So that it is a suchness Imagine me to make and in a slumberous condition to have a vague, unobjectified, still less unsubjectified, sense of redness, or of salt taste, or of an ache, or of grief or joy, or of a prolonged musical note. That would be, as nearly as possible, a purely monadic state of feeling. Now in order to convert that psychological or logical conception into a metaphysical one, we must think of a metaphysical monad as a pure nature, or quality, in itself without parts or features, and without embodiment. Such is a pure monad. The meanings of names of &quot;secondary&quot; qualities are as good approximations to examples of monads as can be given.&quot;</skos:editorialNote>

        <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Generals are classes, types or kinds (natural kinds or classes) whose members are instances that share intensional or extensional aspects with other instance members.

In Peircean terms, &apos;generals&apos; are collections of individuals or predicates that have the same properties or characteristics (are intensional). Generals may be organized into a hierarchy of sub-types, with children inheriting the properties or characteristics of the parent(s). It is thus possible to infer across sub-type lineages. Generals are also sometimes referred to as either types or kinds.</skos:definition>
        <skos:editorialNote xml:lang="en">Generals include all of the types in the KBpedia Knowledge Ontology (KKO). The types themselves are organized into typologies, segregated by the SuperTypes noted under this branch. Most of the typologies (especially those marked as &apos;major&apos; ones) are disjoint (non-overlapping) with one another. This disjointedness is a key structural aspect in being able to reason and slice-and-dice the entire KBpedia knowledge space.</skos:editorialNote>
        <skos:editorialNote xml:lang="en">Note there is a degree of structural similarity between the main Particulars branch in KKO and the main Generals branch. This structural similarity is because Particulars deal with the nature and classification of individuals or instances, while Generals deal with the quite similar classification of classes or types. Fundamentally, all instances are characterized according to the Particulars branch; all types are characterized according to the Generals branch.</skos:editorialNote>

Quiddity describes properties that a particular entity (e.g., an automobile) shares with others of its kind. It is not exactly equivalent to essence, since some shared properties may not be central to a thing&apos;s essence. For example, an automobile may share with another automobile the property of tinted windows, but that character is not central to the automobile&apos;s essence.</skos:definition>

It is through the intense knowledge gained by studying these domains that can produce the insights for new knowledge. 

Knowledge domains are often the focus of academic studies and disciplines, what OpenCyc calls FieldsOfStudy. Systematic human activity in these domains creates, builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the domain at hand (which may result in the expansion into new domains).</skos:definition>

        <dc:description xml:lang="en">The methodeutic, so coined by Charles S. Peirce to distinguish from common methods, is nonetheless the methodology and techniques for inquiry and knowledge development, expressed as the scientific method in its fullest form. Abductive reasoning and hypothesis generation are key aspects of the method, which involves, for any given domain, observing and questioning the facts and generalities of the domain in order to discover new knowledge. That new knowledge results from posing and testing hypotheses about the possible explanations for the observations and potentials.

The methodeutic is the penultimate and last step in logical inquiry. The new knowledge generated as a result of the methodeutic then becomes the object of subsequent inspection and inquiry, with new hypotheses generated and new tests conducted. In this manner knowledge is discovered, confirmed or denied, which forms the basis for extensions and revisions to the current knowledge base.</dc:description>

        <skos:editorialNote xml:lang="en">No. 27 of Methodeutic. The first business of this memoir is to show the precise nature of methodeutic; how it differs from critic; how, although it considers not what is admissable but what is advantageous, it is nevertheless a purely theoretical study, and not an art; how it is from the most strictly theoretical point of view, an absolutely essential and distinct department of logical inquiry; and how upon the other hand, it is readily made useful to a researcher into any science, even mathematics. It strongly resembles the purely mathematical part of political economy, which is also a theoretical study of advantages. Of the different classes of arguments, abductions are the only ones in which after they have been admitted to be just, it still remains to inquire whether they are advantageous. But since the whole business of heuretic, so far as its theory goes, falls under methodeutic, there is no kind of argumentation that methodeutic can pass over without notice. Nor is methodeutic confined to the consideration of arguments. On the contrary, its special subjects have always been understood to be the definition and division of terms. The formation of systems of propositions, although it has been neglected, should also evidently be included in methodeutic. In its method, methodeutic is less strict than critic.

A monadic dyad is the realization of these dyads, making real the possibility by conceptualizing or discussing them.

A monadic dyad is a realized thing, but it is not clear if it is an individual or instance. If it could be so grasped, it would be an entity.</skos:definition>

        <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Monads are what CSP called &quot;indecomposables&quot;, that is fundamental concepts and ideas that are integral to themselves and can not be &quot;decomposed&quot; into smaller units or concepts. The purest form (a First) of monads is what CSP called Quality or Feeling. it is the unrealized possiblity or potential of a sensation. (If realized, it becomes Secondness.) CSP maintained (proved) that all complex structures and concepts can be &quot;decomposed&quot; to no more than two (Secondenss, or Relations or Facts) or three (Thirdness, or Mediation or Thought) of these monads. The concept of these monads together and in themselves constitutes a monad in that the idea or concept of them stands on its own, and can not be &quot;decomposed&quot; to smaller units.</skos:definition>
        <skos:editorialNote xml:lang="en">CSP considered the term &apos;elements&apos; but rejected it as not sufficiently precise. &apos;Primitives&apos; are also a possible term, but is not used because CSP reserved that term for some kinds of relations.</skos:editorialNote>
        <skos:editorialNote xml:lang="en">Concepts that are Firstness and at the appropriate level of generality, but NOT yet included in this Monads branch are:

    Beauty
    Ethics
    State
    Truth</skos:editorialNote>
        <skos:editorialNote xml:lang="en">From CP 1.328: &quot;The being of a monadic quality is a mere potentiality, without existence. Existence is purely dyadic.&quot;</skos:editorialNote>
        <skos:editorialNote xml:lang="en">We can have first, second, and third monads because the idea of the things can be seen as a possibility in itself. As CSP states in CP 1.450: &quot;The first of these is that any unit (or units) whatsoever contemplated in itself without conscious regard to its parts would, were our sense to respond to it, be seen to embody a monad.&quot;

Peirce goes on to say (in CP 1.451): &quot;What has been here affirmed of collections of units is equally true of collections of monads. Namely, any monads may be contemplated together, and in their monadic aspect without regard to the single monads are seen to be one monad. There is thus a relation between monads similar to the relation of a unit to a monad. But there is this difference in the two cases: a monad thus embraced under another monad is so embraced in its very mode of being, while that a unit should be embraced under a monad has no concern with the mode of existence of the unit, which lies in its brute self-identity and otherness from all the rest.&quot;

What this means is that a *type*, a natural class or natural kind, can itself be represented as a monad when considered in its entirety (as the idea or concept, not as its collection of members). We can thus apply the same idea of dyadic relations as applied to monads as being applicable to the type ideal. This formulation is somewhat akin to the idea of &quot;punning&quot; in the OWL 2 language.</skos:editorialNote>

Particulars arise from a head-butting duality of action and reaction, and exist totally in the present. Both events and entities are kinds of particulars.

Particulars may be understood in an intensional sense, wherein they are defined through a set of characteristics or attributes, the necessary and sufficient properties for belonging to that set. Or, particulars may be understood in an extensional sense, wherein they are defined as one of the members within the set or concept at hand, which is a more relational or contextual view. Particulars may also be a part of something broader so long as they have their own discrete identity. For examples, a specific tire or engine may be an individual or particular part of a car; a baton pass may be a moment within a relay race.</skos:definition>

This is the first (Primary) economic sector, based on the classical breakdown of economic activity into three sectors: * Primary: involves the retrieval and production of raw materials, such as corn, coal, wood and iron. (A coal miner, farmer or fisherman would be workers in the primary sector); * Secondary: involves the transformation of raw or intermediate materials into goods e.g. manufacturing steel into cars, or textiles into clothing. (A builder and a dressmaker would be workers in the secondary sector); and * Tertiary: involves the supplying of services to consumers and businesses, such as baby-sitting, cinema and banking. (A shopkeeper and an accountant would be workers in the tertiary sector.) This sector contains the UNSPSC segments 10000000 to 21000000, inclusive.</skos:definition>

If there is but a single linear respect such that, whatever two conceivable determinations of a quantity be taken, they can differ in that respect alone, it is called a simple quantity; but a quantity whose determinations can differ from others in different linear respects is called a complex quantity. The expressed determination of a quantity in all its linear respects of determination (especially if the expression be such that the determination is exact, that is, is a single one and is not any other), is called the value of the quantity.&quot;</skos:editorialNote>

        <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Reference Concepts are a distinct subset of the more broadly understood concept such as used in the SKOS RDFS controlled vocabulary or formal concept analysis or the very general or abstract concepts common to some upper ontologies.

Reference Concepts are selected for their use as concrete, subject-related or commonly used notions for describing tangible ideas and referents in human experience and language. Reference Concepts are classes, the members of which are nameable instances or named entities, which by definition are held as distinct from these concepts. The KKO ontology is a coherently organized structure (or reference &quot;backbone&quot;) of these Reference Concepts. </skos:definition>
        <skos:editorialNote xml:lang="en">It is not unusual to want to treat things either as a class or an instance in an ontology, depending on context. Among other aspects, this is known as metamodeling and it can be accomplished in a number of ways. One of the reasons KKO is modeled using the Web Ontology Language (OWL2) is its ability to provide a neat trick for doing this called “punning“.

Let&apos;s take the example of &apos;trucks&apos; for why we may want to pun.  We may have a category called &apos;trucks&apos;, which may further be split into truck types, brands of trucks, type of engine, and so forth. Yet, when talking about the idea of &apos;truck&apos;, we may want to characterize that a truck is designed primarily for the transport of cargo (as opposed to automobiles for people transport), or that trucks may have different drivers license requirements or different license fees than autos, or certain sizes or weights. These descriptive properties refer to trucks as an instance.

These mixed cases combine both the organization of concepts in relation to one another and with respect to their set members, and with the description and characterization of these concepts as things unto themselves. This is a natural and common way to express most any domain of interest. Where we have different contexts for describing or discussing &apos;trucks&apos;, punning gives us the abiity to model both contexts.

The punning technique works because the IRI for the object ends up being treated as both a concept (class) and an instance (individual). Thus, while the object shares the same IRI, depending on its context, it is evaluated by an OWL reasoner as a different thing (class or individual). The OWL API achieves this by actually writing out the object in both its class view and individual view.

Because of the KKO&apos;s role (among others) as a reference structure for mapping and interoperating external data, it is helpful to think of all of the Reference Concepts (RCs) in the system as classes. This can apply to things which are seemingly individuals, such as specific persons or events, because they may be referred to in multiple ways and in multiple contexts. On the other hand, we want to describe and provide characteristics for these RCs, a view best accomplished when the RC is treated as an instance. Thus, all RCs in the KKO are punned.

External relations are assertions between an object, event, entity, type, or concept and another particular or general. An external relationship has the form of A:B. External relations may be simple ones of a direct relationship between two different instances. External relations may be copulative by combining objects or asserting membership, quantity, action or circumstance. Or, external relations may be mediative to provide meaning, context, relevance, generalizations, or other explanations of the subject with respect to the external world. External relations are extensional.

These external relations have been categorized according to these distinctions and grouped and organized into types.</skos:definition>

These are divisions in regard to the amount of opposition between relative and correlative.&quot;</skos:editorialNote>
        <skos:editorialNote xml:lang="en">This entire branch likely requires further attention and refinement. A key source for this possible change is CSP&apos;s lengthy discussion on &apos;dyadic relations&apos; (see further CP 3.571).

Under that dichotomous scheme, all of the dyadic relations are presented in a dichotomous manner. Further, Concurrents and Opponents are further down the dyadic relation change, all being &apos;Existential Relations&apos;.

The term refers to the formal structure of role and status that can form in a small, stable group. An individual may belong to multiple social systems at once; examples of social systems include nuclear family units, communities, cities, nations, college campuses, corporations, and industries. The organization and definition of groups within a social system depend on various shared characteristics such as location, socioeconomic status, race, religion, societal function, or other distinguishable features, and may cover perspectives on issues held by different groups.

Social systems attempt to capture the complex systems and processes pursued by humans as social groups.</skos:definition>

When referring to a parent thing, the synonym is typical, which relates to types, wherein multiple, shared attributes comprise the types. The shared characteristics of an individual to other individuals in its class constitutes its typicality.</skos:definition>

 consists of the production of services instead of end products. Services (also known as &quot;intangible goods&quot;) include attention, advice, access, experience, and affective labor. The production of information has also long been regarded as a service. This is the third (Tertiary) economic sector, based on the classical breakdown of economic activity into three sectors: * Primary: involves the retrieval and production of raw materials, such as corn, coal, wood and iron. (A coal miner, farmer or fisherman would be workers in the primary sector); * Secondary: involves the transformation of raw or intermediate materials into goods e.g. manufacturing steel into cars, or textiles into clothing. (A builder and a dressmaker would be workers in the secondary sector); and * Tertiary: involves the supplying of services to consumers and businesses, such as baby-sitting, cinema and banking. (A shopkeeper and an accountant would be workers in the tertiary sector.) This sector contains the UNSPSC segments 70000000 to 94000000, inclusive.</skos:definition>
