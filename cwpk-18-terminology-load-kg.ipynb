    "### Basic KBpedia Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "In KBpedia there are three main groupings of constituents (or\n",
    "components). These are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Instances** (or individuals) — the basic, 'ground level'\n",
    "    components of an ontology. An instance is an individual member of a\n",
    "    class, also used synonymously with entity. The instances in KKO may\n",
    "    include concrete objects such as people, animals, tables,\n",
    "    automobiles, molecules, and planets, as well as abstract instances\n",
    "    such as numbers and words. An instance is also known as an\n",
    "    individual, with member and entity also used somewhat\n",
    "    interchangeably. Most instances in KBpedia come from external\n",
    "    sources, like Wikidata, that are mapped to the system;\n",
    "-   **Relations** — a connection between any two objects, entities or\n",
    "    types, or an internal attribute of that thing. Relations are known\n",
    "    as '<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">properties</span>' in the OWL\n",
    "    language;\n",
    "-   **Types** (or classes or kinds) — are aggregations of entities or\n",
    "    things with many shared attributes (though not necessarily the same\n",
    "    values for those attributes) and that share a common essence, which\n",
    "    is the defining determinant of the type. See further the description\n",
    "    for the [type-token\n",
    "    distinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type%E2%80%93token_distinction).\n",
    "\n",
    "(You will note I often refer to 'things' because that is the\n",
    "highest-level ('root') construct in the OWL2 language. 'Thing' is also a\n",
    "convenient sloppy term to refer to everything in a given\n",
    "conversation.)  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can liken <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">instances</span> and <span\n",
    "style=\"font-weight: bold;\">types</span> (or individual and classes,\n",
    "respectively, using semantic terminology) to the 'nouns' or 'things' of\n",
    "the system. Concepts are another included category. Because we use\n",
    "KBpedia as an upper ontology that provides reference points for\n",
    "aggregating external information, even things that might normally be\n",
    "considered as an 'individual', such as [John F.\n",
    "Kennedy](https://kbpedia.org/knowledge-graph/reference-concept/?uri=JohnKennedy),\n",
    "are treated as a 'class' in our system. That does not mean that we are\n",
    "confusing John F. Kennedy with a group of people, just that external\n",
    "references may include many different types of information about 'John\n",
    "F. Kennedy' such as history, impressions by others, or articles\n",
    "referencing him, among many possibilities, that have a strong or\n",
    "exclusive relation to the individual we know as JFK. One reason we use\n",
    "the OWL2 language, among many, is that we can treat Kennedy as both an\n",
    "individual and an aggregage (class) when we define this entity as a\n",
    "'class'. How we then refer to JFK as we go forward -- a 'concept' around\n",
    "the person or an individual with personal attributes -- is interpreted\n",
    "based on context using this OWL2 'metamodeling' construct. Indeed, this\n",
    "is how all of us tend to use natural language in any case.\n",
    "\n",
    "We term these formal 'nouns' or subjects in KBpedia **reference\n",
    "concepts**. RefConcepts, or RCs, are a distinct subset of the more\n",
    "broadly understood 'concept' such as used in the SKOS RDFS controlled\n",
    "vocabulary or [formal concept\n",
    "analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_concept_analysis) or the\n",
    "very general or abstract concepts common to some upper ontologies.\n",
    "RefConcepts are selected for their use as concrete, subject-related or\n",
    "commonly used notions for describing tangible ideas and referents in\n",
    "human experience and language. RCs are classes, the members of which are\n",
    "nameable instances or named entities, which by definition are held as\n",
    "distinct from these concepts. The KKO knowledge graph is a coherently\n",
    "organized structure (or reference 'backbone') of these RefConcepts.\n",
    "There are more than 58,000 RCs in KBpedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "The <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">types</span> in KBpedia, which are\n",
    "predominantly RCs but also may be other aggregates, may be organized in\n",
    "a hierarchical manner, which means we can have 'types of types'. In the\n",
    "aggregate, then, we sometimes talk of these aggregations as, for\n",
    "example:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Attribute types** — an aggregation (or class) of multiple\n",
    "    attributes that have similar characteristics amongst themselves (for\n",
    "    example, colors or ranks or metrics). As with other types, shared\n",
    "    characteristics are subsumed over some essence(s) that give the type\n",
    "    its unique character;\n",
    "-   **Datatypes** — pre-defined ways that attribute values may be\n",
    "    expressed, including various literals and strings (by language),\n",
    "    URIs, Booleans, numbers, date-times, etc. See [XSD (XML Schema\n",
    "    Definition)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Schema_%28W3C%29) for\n",
    "    more information;\n",
    "-   **Relation types** — an aggregation (or class) of multiple relations\n",
    "    that have similar characteristics amongst themselves. As with other\n",
    "    types, shared characteristics are subsumed over some essence(s) that\n",
    "    give the type its unique character;\n",
    "-   **SuperTypes** (also Super Types) — are a collection of (mostly)\n",
    "    similar reference concepts. Most of the SuperType classes have been\n",
    "    designed to be (mostly) disjoint from the other SuperType classes,\n",
    "    these are termed 'core'; other SuperTypes used mostly for\n",
    "    organizational purposes are termed 'extended'. There are about 80\n",
    "    SuperTypes in total, with 30 or so deemed as 'core'. SuperTypes thus\n",
    "    provide a higher-level of clustering and organization of reference\n",
    "    concepts for use in user interfaces and for reasoning purposes;\n",
    "    and  \n",
    "-   **Typologies** — flat, hierarchical taxonomies comprised of related\n",
    "    entity types within the context of a given KBpedia SuperType (ST).\n",
    "    Typologies have the most general types at the top of the hierarchy;\n",
    "    the more specific at the bottom. Typologies are a critical\n",
    "    connection point between the [TBox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tbox) (RCs) and [ABox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abox) (instances), with\n",
    "    each type in the typology providing a possible tie-in point to\n",
    "    external content.\n",
    "\n",
    "One simple organizing framework is to see a <span\n",
    "style=\"font-weight: bold;\">typology</span> as a hierarchical\n",
    "organization of <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">types</span>. In the\n",
    "case of KBpedia, all of these types are <span\n",
    "style=\"font-weight: bold;\">reference concepts</span>, some of which may\n",
    "be instances under the right context, organized under a single node or\n",
    "'root', which is the <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">SuperType</span>.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a different fundamental split, <span\n",
    "style=\"font-weight: bold;\">relations</span> are the 'verbs' of the\n",
    "KBpedia system and cleave into three main branches:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Direct relations</span> —\n",
    "    interactions that may occur between two or more things or concepts;\n",
    "    the relations are all extensional;\n",
    "-   **Attributes** — the characteristics, qualities or descriptors that\n",
    "    signify individual things, be they entities or concepts. Attributes\n",
    "    are known through the terms of depth, comprehension, significance,\n",
    "    meaning or connotation; that is, what is intensional to the thing.\n",
    "    [Key-value\n",
    "    pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute%E2%80%93value_pair)\n",
    "    match an attribute with a value; it may be an actual value, one of a\n",
    "    set of values, or a descriptive label or string;\n",
    "-   **Annotations** — a way to describe, label, or point to a given\n",
    "    thing. Annotations are in relation to a given thing at hand and are\n",
    "    not inheritable. Indexes or codes or pointers or indirect references\n",
    "    to a given thing without a logical resolution (such as 'see also')\n",
    "    are annotations, as well as statements about things, such as what is\n",
    "    known as metadata. (Contrasted to an attribute, which is an\n",
    "    individual characteristic intrinsic to a data object or instance,\n",
    "    metadata is a description about that data, such as how or when\n",
    "    created or by whom).\n",
    "\n",
    "Annotations themselves have some important splits. One is the\n",
    "**preferred label** (or <code>prefLabels</code>), a readable string (name) for each\n",
    "of the RCs in KBpedia, and is the name most often used in user\n",
    "interfaces and such. <code>altLabels</code> are multiple alternate names for an RC,\n",
    "which when done fairly comprehensively are called **semsets**. A semset\n",
    "can often have many entries and phrases, and may include true synonyms,\n",
    "but also jargon, buzzwords, acronyms, epithets, slang, pejoratives,\n",
    "metonyms, stage names, diminuitives, pen names, derogatives, nicknames,\n",
    "hypochorisms, sobriquets, cognomens, abbreviations, or pseudonyms; in\n",
    "short, any term or phrase that can be a reference to a given thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "These <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">bolded terms</span> have special\n",
    "meanings within KBpedia. To make these concepts computable, we also need\n",
    "correspondence to the various semantic language standards and then to\n",

You will see two files named 'kbpedia_reference_concepts'. One has an \\*.n3 extension for Notation3, a simple RDF notation. The other has an \\*.owl extension. This is the exact same ontology saved by Protégé in RDF/XML notation, and is the standard one used by owlready2. Thus, we want to use the <code>kbpedia_reference_concepts.owl</code> file.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"background-color:#eee; border:1px dotted #aaa; vertical-align:middle; margin:15px 60px; padding:8px;\">Another reason we want to load this full KBpedia knowledge graph is to see if your current configuration has enough memory for the task. If, after the steps below, you are unable to load KBpedia, you may need a memory change to proceed. You may either need to change your internal memory allocations for Python or add more physical memory to your machine. We offer no further support, though outside research may help you diagnose and correct these conditions in order to proceed.</div>\n",

Launch directories move all over the place when interacting with Python programs across your system. A good practice is to be literal and absolute in your file addressing in Python scripts.\n",

    "We are doing two things in the script below. The first is that we are setting the variable <code>main</code> to our absolute file address on our Window system. Note we could use the '<code>r</code>' (raw) switch to reference the Windows backslash in its file system syntax, <code>r'C:\\1-PythonProjects\\kbpedia\\sandbox\\kbpedia_reference_concepts.owl'</code>. We could also 'escape' the backward slash by preferencing each such illegal character with the '/' forward slash. We can also rely on Python already accommodating Windows file notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part of the script below is to iterate over <code>main</code> and print to screen each line in the ontology file. This confirmation occurs when we <code>shift+enter</code> and the cell tells us the file reference is correct and working fine by writing the owl file to screen.
