    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "To this point, we have accumulated a growing roster of methods for extracting and building [KBpedia](https://kbpedia.org/), and utilities to support those processes. With this growing maturity from our [*Cooking with Python and KBpedia*](https://www.mkbergman.com/cooking-with-python-and-kbpedia/) series, it is time for us to put in place a formal testing regime for *cowpoke* and to take the steps to register it as a formal Python package. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of [unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) is to assemble simple tests of single code functions that may be exercised whenever we deem changes in our code base warrants. These simple programs evaluate against a known results set to determine whether the routine still performs as expected. Unit tests are not a blanket approval of a method, but a way to ascertain whether certain key functions perform as expected. Unit testing is viewed by many as the foundation for integrated tests, the combination of which are one of the most important improvements in software development of the past 30 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with so many other areas, there is a diversity of modules available to aid the testing process in [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)). The [<code>unittest</code>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unit_testing_frameworks#Python) module is a part of Python's standard library, and is our basis as well. But we will layer on to that a series of modules that will enable us to guide and develop our unit tests directly through the [Spyder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyder_(software)) [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment).\n",
    "\n",
    "I am most assuredly an amateur programmer. As I've stated before, I have never been paid a dime for writing a line of code. (And, now after more than halfway through this series, you can probably see why!) But since there is a widespread view that unit testing is a best practice, from Day One in my plan for this **CWPK** series I had slotted in one or two installments to learn and implement some unit tests. I began this particular installment with a high expectation, and indeed wrote most of this intro before I sat down to focus on learning and implementing tests. Yet I reached a conclusion quite contrary to my expectations. I'm writing this last sentence here just as I wrap up this investigation, with a slight taste of ashes that reminds me of our various experiences with the somewhat related area of [agile programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development). For my purposes and personality, there is just too much process, diversion, and [paint-by-the-numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paint_by_number) to make unit testing a formal part of my workflow. I think I can see applications in large team development with mission-critical interdependencies, but my major realization is that I am already doing comprehensive, integrated testing. Unit tests are a diversion and a productivity loss, as I presently see them, in the case of knowledge graph [roundtripping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-trip_format_conversion).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, that being said, we still have the imperative to package up our **CWPK** code, which we have named *cowpoke*, as a standard Python package that we can readily make available through the common channels of [GitHub](https://github.com/Cognonto/cowpoke) and [pip](https://pypi.org/project/cowpoke/). We conclude this installment with our efforts in these areas, which now means you have complete and unfettered access to all of the code we have prepared to date through these **CWPK** installments."

    "### Installing the Environment\n",
    "To enable Spyder as our <code>unittest</code> interface, I began by installing a package extension specific to that task:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "  conda install -c spyder-ide spyder-unittest\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "The <code>unittest</code> operations in Spyder also requires the <code>pytest</code> module, which is already part of my base installation, but we make sure anyway:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "  conda install pytest\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "You will want to set up a folder under your project for 'tests' and to write your test files, often multiples, to this directory for the package. As you install, you may be asked to grant some permissions, and here is where you will configure to point to your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should then logout and restart your computer, and return to your project to continue.  The system will also install a separate <code>.pytest_cache</code> directory under your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "I found, like Python packages in general, the install and addition of the testing modules to be smooth and easy. A new pane gets created (upper right by default) in Spyder, and test run options appear under the Spyder Run menu item."

    "### Anatomy of a Unit Test\n",
    "By definition, a unit test is limited to a single \"unit\" often used synonymously as a discrete function or algorithm. [Ted Kaminsky](https://www.tedinski.com/2018/11/27/contradictory-tdd.html) nicely summarizes the standard guidance as to what constitutes a good unit test:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tests should only test one thing\n",
    "1. Each test should be independent and self-contained\n",
    "1. Refactoring should not break tests\n",
    "1. Try to achieve maximal coverage with tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "A commitment to unit tests encourages more public methods and greater piecing apart of routines. The general form of a unit test looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "  fixtures\n",
    "  def test_test\n",
    "      setup\n",
    "      assert\n",
    "      test\n",
    "      teardown\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "The <code>pytest</code> module uses 'fixtures' as a way to set up input templates of state or connectivity needed as inputs to the function. The unit test function is named, by convention, with a <code>test_</code> prefix that informs the module a test is available. Though your production routines may favor shorter or more cryptic variable and function names, within the unit test environment best practice is to use longer and descriptive labels, since the tests and how they are being reported occur in a separate testing panel removed in both code and space from the subject routine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each test goes through an initial setup portion and then concludes with a teardown, where the temporary test structures are released when the test is done. The actual tests are done against assertions that have pre-determined 'correct' results, so that the test can evaluate to *pass* or *fail*. Multiple assertions may be evaluated in a given unit test, so more than one pass-fail may be returned. Like unit tests across tools and languages, results that pass are often shown in green on the screen, fails in red."

    "I then began to lay out my plan of attack on paper. When I research such matters I note sources that seem to have good code examples and I will mark them for later consultation, but my initial investigations are spent more on finding clear coding approaches and constructs and generalities or patterns for how to set up things. One of the first observations is that all of my roundtripping routines involved quite a bit of I/O and configuration. I was therefore looking especially for guidance around the idea of '[fixtures](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.html)' or 'parameters' with <code>pytest</code>. A second observation is that most of my <code>utils.py</code> routines are used infrequently, sometimes no more frequently than once every build or three. These were not heavily used routines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the unit test examples I came across were toy cases, such as adding or multiplying a couple of numbers or concatenating some strings. I tried to focus my investigations on use of [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) files, since that is such a central construct in our knowledge graph approach. I started to see hints that perhaps unit tests are not a good idea for file and I/O purposes. A quote from the user [Dunes](https://stackoverflow.com/users/529630/dunes) on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32527861/python-unit-test-that-uses-an-external-data-file) seemed to best capture the sense I was gaining from my research:  \"Unit tests that access the file system are generally not a good idea. This is because the test should be self contained, by making your test data external to the test it's no longer immediately obvious which test the csv file belongs to or even if it's still in use.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Hmmm. I could see that, good idea or not, what I was going to have to do to set up my tests and get them \"mocked\" up for all of the I/O and data staging I would need was not a trivial matter. It was also perhaps the case that my general roundtripping routines, with their many steps and loops, were already too complex for unit testing. It was beginning to dawn on me that to design my unit tests properly, I would need to further piece apart my existing routines into more atomic functions. Wow, I really did not like that idea, since it would kick me all of the way back to Square One and force me to re-factor all of my code to date. And I had been making such great progress!\n",
    "\n",
    "I could see that unit testing was not going to be some minor 'adder' to improve best practices, but more akin to a whole change in philosophy and approach. It was at minimum looking that I would need to double the size of my code base, learn a bunch of whole new stuff needed by the test machinery, change my design and architecture, and for examples of isolated functions that told me nothing about application-wide behavior and seemed to only test what I already knew to be true. Ouch! This unit test stuff was not looking to be a good deal."

    "### Calling Time Out and Testing Premises\n",
    "We had similar realizations about the use of agile development in the past. While we are a boutique development shop that tends to work on smaller, bespoke projects, we have also been subcontractors on much larger teams with enterprise-scale budgets and project management. It is sometimes exciting, often lucrative, and too frequently exasperating to work on big, multi-team projects. We understand the discipline needed for larger-scale projects and can see the merit (if lightly applied) of agile approaches. But too often agile is just another way to kill innovation and productivity through too many meetings and process.\n",

    "I had taken as a given that unit testing was an unalloyed good. But, here I was, barely hours into a concerted investigation, and I was seeing serious red flags. Because I had initially not questioned the premise, I had not specifically looked into criticisms or critics of unit testing. The truth is, I had just taken it all as a given and had not inspected my testing assumptions. I believe in my bones in the merit of tested and vetted information products, but perhaps unit testing was not a way to go in our circumstance. What was indeed best and true here?\n",

Some of the criticism is empirical, some philosophical or nuanced.\n",

    "### Framing Testing in a Different Light\n",
    "This more open-minded investigation of the question of unit testing has changed my perspective. My impression is that there is a place and likely best practices and methods for doing unit testing. However, an excessive insistence on unit testing may actually be counter-productive by distorting incentives and leading to code proliferation and fragmentation. Paradoxically, this may make the code base harder to maintain and make it more difficult to discover integrated or system issues. One area that concerns me is in RESTful or Web-based distributed development where APIs and interfaces are prominent, but hard to mock up. The lack of examples useful to my needs is another concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "More fundamentally, this exercise has caused me to think of testing in a new light. I remain convinced that testing and reliability are paramount, but that has meaning only in relation to the ultimate deliverables or purposes, not the individual pieceparts. The objective is the *purpose* of the software, not unit testing *per se*. \n",
    "\n",
    "A roundtripping objective, my governing *purpose*, is, actually, a system test of the highest order. We need to be able to break down and manipulate a knowledge artifact, re-build it again, and be able to inspect and use it in process-heavy external environments. Being able to load and inspect and apply logic tests in a totally different [Protégé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prot%C3%A9g%C3%A9_(software)) environment is a demanding system test for whether our code base has been accurate in the entire cycle of transformations. I'm already doing loads of testing, and relevant, too. My realization was that the entire basis of my **CWPK** series was to create an artifact, test it for coherence, modify it, and then test it for coherence again. Such roundtripping is indeed a demanding task.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am glad I began with the premise of instituting some unit tests in the *cowpoke* project. It has caused me to think more clearly about why test in the first place, and that achieving end goals should take precedence over adhering to any particular method or process. There is no end to the learning, is there?\n",
    "\n",
    "The conclusion about the immediate objective was to put unit testing off to the side. If I can completely break down and then re-build a knowledge graph, there is no shame in not doing unit testing."

    "1. Went to the directory where the *cowpoke* code is stored under my local Python projects\n",
    "1. Using Git, created a new repository at this location\n",
    "1. Committed all existing Python files in that directory to the new repository\n",
    "1. Added the additional files needed for <code>pip</code> as detailed in the next section\n",
    "1. Created an empty <code>cowpoke</code> repository under our main branch (<code>Cognonto</code>) in GitHub\n",
    "1. Using TortoiseGit under my local file system, 'pushed' the local Git repository to GitHub.\n",

That file is created under the next set of steps and is 'pushed' to this new directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon completion of the next steps, I then 'pushed' my local files to GitHub. I did so by picking [TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org/) when in the root of my local *cowpoke* directory, and then I entered the HTTPS link for the empty directory on GitHub as the remote URI location. That link is found under the green 'Code' button at the upper right of the GitHub *cowpoke* directory. For reference, this link is:\n",

    "I will speak more about the use of GitHub at the conclusion of this **CWPK** series.

    "1. Go to the *cowpoke* GitHub location indicated above\n",

    "However, it is easier to treat *cowpoke* as a standard Python package, and we created one and did so by following guidelines for the [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) installer package (pip).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I did a test installation at [test.pypi.org](https://test.pypi.org/) using this step-by-step [guide](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/). There are a few required files that each package must contain, including notably:\n",

    "All of these requirements and the steps to follow are outlined in the [guide](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Windows is a little tricky. I had a hard time using the Apache 2 license, so fell back to the MIT one. Also, the acceptance of tokens, as suggested by the guide, proved problematic, possibly due to lack of a <code>\\$HOME</code> directory on my Windows machine. I used my straight login and password names for the test site instead, and that worked fine. One must also have the <code>setup.py</code> working just right, or the test will fail with an error. (You can run <code>python setup.py -install</code> to check your pip packages locally.) Also, the instructions kept insisting I use '<code>python3</code>', but my local configuration sets Python directly to version 3, so the numeral was not causing Python to run properly; using the simple <code>python</code> did the trick for my environment. \n",

Per the test site instructions, I had already installed the [twine](https://pypi.org/project/twine/) install assistance package. So, after logging into the PyPI support, we begin the upload process with:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>python -m twine upload dist/*</code>\n",

    "<code>https://pypi.org/project/cowpoke/</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, it is important to know that one can not update this information without incrementing the version number. So, it is essential that the input information be accurate and complete, which means the test upload is a very important step.\n",
