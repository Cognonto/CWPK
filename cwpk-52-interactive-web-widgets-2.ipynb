    "In our last installment of the [*Cooking with Python and KBpedia*](https://www.mkbergman.com/cooking-with-python-and-kbpedia/) series, I discussed the rationale for using distributed Web widgets as one means to bring the use and management of a knowledge graph into closer alignment with existing content tasks. The idea is to embed small Web controls as either plug-ins, enhancements to existing application Web interfaces, or as simply accompanying Web pages. Under this design, ease-of-use and immediacy are paramount in order to facilitate the capture of new knowledge if and where it arises.\n",
    "\n",
    "More complicated knowledge graph tasks like initial builds, bulk changes, logic testing and the like are therefore kept as separate tasks. For our immediate knowledge purposes, knowledge workers should be able to issue suggestions for new concepts or modifications or deletions when they are discovered. These suggested modifications may be made to a working version of the knowledge graph that operates in parallel to a public (or staff-wide) release version. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic concept behind this and the previous installment is that we would like to have the ability to use simple widgets -- embedded on any Web page for the applications we use -- as a means of capturing and communicating immediate new information of relevance to our knoweldge graphs. In a distributed manner, while working with production versions, we may want to communicate these updates to an interim version in the queue for review and promotion via a governance pipeline that might lead to a new production version.\n",
    "\n",
    "On some periodic basis, this modified working version could be inspected and tested by assigned managers with the responsibility to vet new, public versions. There is much governance and policy that may guide these workflows, which may also be captured by their own ontologies, that is a topic separate from the widget infrastructure to make this vision operational.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are widgets available for analysis and visualization purposes, which we will touch upon in later installments, the ones we will emphasize in today's **CWPK** installment are focused on [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) (*create - read - update - delete*) activities. CRUD is the means by which we manage our knowledge graphs in the immediate sense. We will be looking to develop these widgets in a manner directly useful to distributed applications."
