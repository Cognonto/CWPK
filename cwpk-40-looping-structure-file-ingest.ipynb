    "- First, last installment's structure build routine (as designed) requires three passes to complete file ingest. Each one of those passes has a duplicate code section to convert our file input forms to required shorter versions. We would like to extract these duplicates as a helper function in order to lesson code complexity and improve readability\n",

    "### Looping Over Files\n",
    "If you recall our extraction steps of getting flat [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) files out of [KBpedia](https://kbpedia.org/) in [**CWPK #28**](https://www.mkbergman.com/2363/cwpk-28-extracting-structure-for-typologies/) to [**CWPK #35**](https://www.mkbergman.com/2372/cwpk-35-a-python-module-part-iii-custom-extractions-and-finish-packaging/), we can end up with close to 100 extraction files. These splits encourage modularity and are easier to work on or substitute. Still, when it comes time to building KBpedia back up again after we complete a [roundtrip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-trip_format_conversion), a complete build requires we process many files. We thus need looping routines across our build files to automate this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thought is to simply put groupings of files in individual directories and then point the routine at a directory and instruct it to loop over all files. If we have concerns that the directories may have more file types than we want to process with our current routine, we could also introduce some file name string checks to filter by name, fragment, or extension. These options would enable us to generalize a file looping routine to apply to many conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, I've decided to take a different choice. Since our extractions are driven by Python dictionaries, and we can direct those extractions to any directory prefix, we can re-use these same specifications for build processes. Should we later discover that a general file harvester makes sense, we can generalize at that time from this dictionary design. Also, by applying the same dictionary approach to extraction or building, we help reinforce our roundtripping mindset in how we name and process files.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we already have the unique names that distinguish our input classes (in the <code>typol_dict</code> dictionary in <code>config.py</code>) and our properties (in the <code>prop_dict</code> dictionary), and foresee using additional dictionaries going forward in this **CWPK** series. We only need enter a directory root and the appropriate dictionary to loop over the unique terms associated with our various building blocks. For classes, the typology listing is a great lookup.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will take our generic class build template from the last installment, and put it into a function that loops over opening our file set, running the routine, and then saving to our desired output location. For now, to get the logic right, I will just set this up as a wrapper before actually plopping in the full build loop routine. (**Note**: we have to import a couple of modules because we have not yet fully set the environment for today's installment):"

    "### A Brief History of Going Crazy\n",
    "If we set as an objective being able to specify multiple input files for a current build, a couple of issues immediately arise. Recall, we designed our typology extraction files to be self-contained, which means that every class used as an object must also be declared as its own class subject. To speed up our extractions, we do not keep track of the many objects so needing definitions. That means each encounter triggers the need for another class definition. Multiple duplicate declarations do not cause a problem when loading the ontology, but when used as a specification input when doing multiple passes some tricky problems arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "One obvious contributor to the difficulty is the need to identify and separately keep track of (and sometimes differentially process) our 'kko' and 'rc' namespaces. We need to account for this distinction in every loop and every assignment or removal that we make to the ontology while building it in memory. That can all be trapped for when in the class build cycle, which is the first two passes of the routine (first create the class, second add to parents), but gets decidedly tricky when removing the excess <code>owl:Thing</code> declarations. \n",
    "\n",
    "To appreciate this issue a bit, here is the basic statement for removing a 'Bird' class from a parent 'Reptile':\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>rc.Bird.is_a.remove(rc.Reptile)</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our inputs can not be strings, but in loops variables often become so, and need to be evaluated to their type via the <code>var1.is_a.getattr(rc, var2)</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, when we make a <code>rc.Bird.is_a.remove(rc.Reptile)</code> request once it has been previously removed, the relationship is empty and owlready2 throws an error (as does Python when trying to remove an undeclared object). So, while we are able to extract without keeping track, we eventually do when we come time to build. Thus, as each file is processed, we need to account for prior removals and make sure we do not make the request again.\n",
    "\n",
    "The later part of the code listing above **(4)** kept processing most of the files well, but not when too many were processed. I had the curious error of seeing the routine fail on the first entry of some files. It appeared to me perhaps the list accumulator I was using to keep track of prior removals was limited in size in some manner (it is not) or some counter or loop was not being cleared or initialized in the right location. If it ain't perfect, it don't run.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a newbie with no prior experience to fall back on, here are some of the things I looked at and tested in trying to debug this Pass #3 <code>owl:Thing</code> deletion routine:\n",
    "\n",
    "- memory - was it a memory problem? Well, there are some performance issues we continue with in the next installment, but, no, Python seems to grab the memory it needs and does (apparently) a fair job of garbage cleanup. It was also not a problem with the notebook memory \n",
    "- loops - there are lots of ways to initiate loops or iterate over different structures from lists, sets, dictionaries, length and counters, etc. How loops are called and incremented differ by the iterator type chosen. I suspect this is where the issue still resides, because I continue to not have a native feel for:\n",
    "    - sets v lists\n",
    "    - clearing before loops\n",
    "    - referencing the right loops\n",
    "- using the right fragment - the interplay of namespaces with scope is also not yet intuitive to me. Sometimes it is important to use the namespace prefixed reference to an object, other times not so. I am still learning about scope\n",
    "- not much worried about syntax because REPL was always running\n",
    "- list length limitations -  I discussed this one above, as was able to eliminate it as the source\n",
    "- indentations - it is sometimes possible to put what one thinks is the closing statement to a routine at the wrong indentation, so that it runs, but is not affecting the correct code block. In my debugging efforts so far I often find this a source of the problem, especially when there is too much complexity or editing of the code. This is another reason to generalize duplicate code\n",
    "- code statement placement in order - in a similar way, counters and loop initializations can easily be placed into the wrong spots. The routine often may run, but still not do what you think it is, and\n",
    "- many others - I'm a newbie, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "It was so frustrating trying to get this correct because I could get most everything working like I wanted, but then perhaps the routine would fail in the midst of processing a long list or would complete, but, upon inspection, may have missed some items or treated them incorrectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "What little I do know about such matters tells me to try to pinpoint and isolate the problem. When processing long lists, that means testing for possible error conditions and liberally sprinkling various print statements with different text and different echoing of current values to the screen. For example, in an <code>else:</code> condition of an <code>if:</code> statement, I might put a print like:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "  print('In kko_list loop of None error trap:', var1, var2)\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "But pinpointing a problem does not indicate how to solve it, though it does help to narrow attention. I had done so in the routine above, but I was still erroring out of some files. Sometimes that would happen, but it was still unclear what the offending part might be. When Python errors like that, it provides an error message and trackback, but somethings that information is cryptic. The failure point may occur any time after the last message to screen. Again, I was being pricked by needles in the haystack, but I still had not specifically found and removed them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Error Trapping\n",
    "I knew from my Python reading that it had a fairly good exception mechanism. Since <code>print()</code> statements were only taking me so far, I decided I needed to bite the bullet (for the needle pricks in my hand!) and start learning more about error trapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic approach for allowing a program to continue to run when an error condition is met is through the Python \n",
    "*exception*. It basically looks like this kind of routine:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "   statement1\n",
    "   statement2\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       non_zero = statement1 / statement2\n",
    "   except exception:\n",
    "       print('Oops, dividing by 0!')\n",
    "       continue\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "I was exploring this more graceful way to treat errors when I realized, duh, that same approach also captured exactly what I was trying to accomplish with avoiding multiple deletions in the first place! That is, I could continue to 'try' to delete the next instance of the <code>owl:Thing</code> assigment, and if it had already been deleted (which caused it to throw an exception, that is, what I was trying to fix!), I could exit gracefully and move on. Further, this would allow me to embed specific <code>print()</code> statements at the *exact* point of failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this aHa! I changed the code as shown above **(4)**. I suspect it is a slow way to process the huge numbers I have, but it works. I will continue to look for better means, but at least with this approach I was able to move on with the project.\n",

    "Still, whether for this reason or others not yet contemplated, once we start processing huge numbers with multiple KBpedia build files, I am seeing performance much slower than what I would like. We address those topics in the next installment, which will also cause us to detour still further before we can get back on track to completing our property structure additions to the build."
