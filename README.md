# Cooking with Python and KBpedia

 <img align="left" src="https://kbpedia.org/cwpk-files/cooking-with-kbpedia-305.png" alt="Cooking with KBpedia" />

The *Cooking with Python and KBpedia* series consists of nearly 75
installments that discuss how to pick tools and then use
[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29)
for using and manipulating the [KBpedia](https://kbpedia.org/) knowledge
graph. KBpedia is a unique knowledge system that intertwines seven
'core' public knowledge bases --
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia),
[Wikidata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikidata),
[schema.org](https://schema.org/), [DBpedia](http://dbpedia.org/),
[GeoNames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoNames),
[OpenCyc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyc), and standard [UNSPSC
products and services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNSPSC) -- for the
explicit purpose of providing a computable scaffolding and design for
data interoperability and knowledge-based artificial intelligence
([KBAI](https://www.mkbergman.com/category/kbai/)).

The first installments in the **CWPK** series begin with choices
regarding tools and design. Later installations embed working code into
interactive [Jupyter
Notebooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter#Jupyter_Notebook).
As developed, code is posted to GitHub for your own use and
modification. As installments get published, the ongoing index below
will capture the scope and coverage of this ambitious series.

Interactive notebook pages begin about **CWPK \#14**.
