The *Cooking with Python and KBpedia* series consists of nearly 75
installments that discuss how to pick tools and then use
[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29)
for using and manipulating the [KBpedia](https://kbpedia.org/) knowledge
graph. KBpedia is a unique knowledge system that intertwines seven
'core' public knowledge bases --
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia),
[Wikidata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikidata),
[schema.org](https://schema.org/), [DBpedia](http://dbpedia.org/),
[GeoNames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoNames),
[OpenCyc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyc), and standard [UNSPSC
products and services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNSPSC) -- for the
explicit purpose of providing a computable scaffolding and design for
data interoperability and knowledge-based artificial intelligence
([KBAI](https://www.mkbergman.com/category/kbai/)).

The first installments in the **CWPK** series begin with choices
regarding tools and design. Later installations embed working code into
interactive [Jupyter
Notebooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter#Jupyter_Notebook).
As developed, code is posted to GitHub for your own use and
modification. As installments get published, the ongoing index below
will capture the scope and coverage of this ambitious series.
