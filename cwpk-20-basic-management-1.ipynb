    "<p>Our previous installments of the <a href=\"https://www.mkbergman.com/cooking-with-python-and-kbpedia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Cooking with Python and KBpedia</em></a> series relied on the full knowledge graph, <code>kbpedia_reference_concepts.owl</code>. That approach was useful to test out whether our current <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Python</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jupyter Notebook</a> configurations were adequate to handle the entire 58,000 reference concepts (RCs) in <a href=\"https://kbpedia.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">KBpedia</a>. However, a file that large makes finding and navigating stuff a bit harder. For this installment, and a few that come thereafter, we will restrict our example to the much smaller <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_ontology\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">upper ontology</a> to KBpedia, KKO (Kbpedia Knowledge Ontology). This ontology only has hundreds of concepts, but has the full suite of functionality and component types found in the full system.</p>\n",
    "<p>In today's installment we will apply some of the basic commands in <a href=\"http://www.lesfleursdunormal.fr/static/informatique/owlready/index_en.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">owlready2</a> we learned in the last installment. Owlready2 is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">API</a> to our <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OWL2</a> knowledge graphs. In today's installment we will explore the standard <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CRUD</a> (<em>create-read-update-delete</em>) actions against the classes (reference concepts) in our graph. Since our efforts to date have focused on the R in CRUD (for reading), our emphasis today will be on class creation, updates and deletions.</p>\n",
