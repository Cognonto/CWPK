    "We have noted in previous installments in this [*Cooking with Python and KBpedia*](https://www.mkbergman.com/cooking-with-python-and-kbpedia/) series how important consistent [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) encoding is to [roundtripping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-trip_format_conversion) with our files. One of the ways we can enforce this importance is to consistently read and write files with UTF-8 specified, as discussed in [**CWPK #31**](https://www.mkbergman.com/2366/cwpk-31-reading-and-writing-files/). But, what if we have obtained external information? How can we ensure it is in the proper encoding or has wrong character assignments fixed? If we are going to perform such checks, what other consistency tests might we want to include? In this installment, we add some pre-build routines to test and clean our files for proper ingest.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I noted in [**CWPK #39**](https://www.mkbergman.com/2378/cwpk-39-i-o-and-structural-ingest/), cleaning comes before the build steps in the actual build process. But we wanted to have an understanding of broader information flows throughout the build or use scenarios before formulating the cleaning routines. That is both because they are not always operationally applied, and because working out the build steps was aided by not having to carry around extra routines. Now that we have the ingest and build steps fairly well outlined, it is an easier matter to see where and how cleaning steps best fit into this flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the outset, we know we want to work with clean files when building [KBpedia](https://kbpedia.org/). Do we want such checks to run in every build, or optionally? Do we want to run checks against single files or against entire directories or projects? Further, are we not likely to want to add more checks over time as our experience with the build process and problems encountered increase? Lastly, we can see down the road  (**CWPK #48**) to where we also only want to make incremental changes to an existing knowledge graph, as opposed to building one from scratch or *de novo*. How might that affect cleaning requirements or placement of methods?"

    "### Design Considerations\n",
    "In thinking about these questions, we decided to take this general approach to testing and vetting clean files:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Once vetted, files will remain clean (insofar as the tests run) until next edited. It may not make sense to check all files automatically at the beginning of a build. This point suggests we should have a separate set of cleaning routines from the overall build process. We may later want to include that into an overall complete build routine, but we can do so later as part of a make file approach rather than including cleaning as a mandatory part of all builds.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Once we have assembled our files for a new build, we should assume that all files are unvetted. As build iterations proceed, we only need to vet those files that have been modified. When initially testing a new build, it probably makes sense for us to be able to loop over all of the input files in a given directory (corresponding to most of the subdirectories under <code>kbpedia > version > build</code>; see prior [**CWPK #37**](https://www.mkbergman.com/2376/cwpk-37-organizing-the-code-base/) installment). These points suggest we want the option to configure our clean routines for either all files in a subdirectory or a list of files. To keep configuration complexity lower, we will stipulate that if a list of files is used, they should all be in the same subdirectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Our biggest cleaning concern is that we have clean, UTF-8 text ([encodings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding)) in all of our input files. However, if we need to run this single test, we ought to test for other consistency concerns, as well. Here are the additional tests that look useful in our initial module development:\n",
    "   - Have new fields (columns) been added to our [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) files?\n",
    "   - Are our input files missing already defined fields?\n",
    "   - Are we missing required fields (<code>prefLabel</code> and <code>definition</code>)?\n",
    "   - Are our fields properly constructed (CamelCase with initial cap for classes, initial lowercase for properties, and URI encoding for [IRIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_Resource_Identifier))?\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "4. If we ***do*** have encoding issues, and given the manual effort required to fix them, can we include some form of encoding 'fix' routine? It turns out there is a [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) package for such a routine, that we will test in this installment and include if deemed useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These considerations are what have guided the design of the *cowpoke* <code>clean</code> module. Also, as we noted in [**CWPK #9**](https://www.mkbergman.com/2336/cwpk-9-installing-python/), our design is limited to Python 3x. Python 2 has not been accommodated in *cowpoke*."

    "### A Brief Detour for URIs\n",
    "[KBpedia](https://kbpedia.org/) is a knowledge graph based on semantic technologies and which incorporates seven major public and online knowledge bases: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia), [Wikidata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikidata), [DBpedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBpedia), [schema.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema.org), [GeoNames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoNames), [UNSPSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNSPSC), and [OpenCyc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyc#OpenCyc). A common aspect of all of these sources is that reference to information is a Web string that 'identifies' the item at hand that, when clicked, also takes us to the source of that item. In the early days of the Web this identifier mostly pertained to Web pages and was known as a Universal Resource Locator, or [URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL). They were the underlined blue links of the Web's early days.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, there are other protocols for discovering resources on the Internet beside the Web protocols of [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) and [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS). There is [Gopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)), [FTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol), [email](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol), and others. Also, as information began to proliferate from Web pages to data items within databases and these other sources, the idea of a 'locator' was generalized to include 'identifiers' when it is a data item and not a page. This generalization is known as a [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier), or if a 'name' within other schema or protocols, known as a [URN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Name). Here, for example, is the URI address of the English Wikipedia main page:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that white space is not allowed in this string, and is replaced with underscores in this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The allowed characters that could be used in constructing one of these addresses were limited to mostly [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) characters, with some characters like the forward-slash ('/') forbidden because they are a defined constructor of an address. If one wanted to include non-allowed characters in a URI address, it needed to be [percent encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding). Here, for example, is the English Wikipedia address for its article on the [Côte d'Azur Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%B4te_d%27Azur_Observatory):\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%B4te_d%27Azur_Observatory\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "This format is clearly hard to read. Most Web browsers, for example, decode these strings when you look at the address within the browser, so it appears as this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Côte_d'Azur_Observatory\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "And, in fact, if you submit the string as exactly shown above, encoders at Wikipedia would accept this input string.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Internationalized Resource Identifier ([IRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_Resource_Identifier) was proposed and then adopted on the Web as a way of bringing in a wider range of acceptable characters useful to international languages. Mostly what we see in browsers today is the IRI version of these addresses, even if not initially formulated as such.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sources like Wikipedia and Wikidata restrict their addresses to URIs. A source like DBpedia, on the other hand, supports IRIs. Wikipedia also has a discussion on [how to fix these](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:URL#Fixing_links_with_unsupported_characters) links.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge in these different address formats is that if encoding gets screwed up, IRI versions of addresses can also get screwed up. That might be marginally acceptable when we are encoding something like a definition or comment (an annotation), but absolutely breaks the data record if it occurs to that record's identifying address: Any change or alteration of the exact characters in the address means we can no longer access that data item.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-percent encoded Wikipedia addresses and DBpedia addresses are two problem areas. We also have tried to limit KBpedia's identifiers to the ASCII version of these international characters. For example, the KBpedia item for [Côte-d'Or](https://kbpedia.org/knowledge-graph/reference-concept/?uri=CoteDOr) shows as the address:  \n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "  http://kbpedia.org/kko/rc/CoteDOr\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "We still have a readable label, but one with encoding traps removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "I provide this detour to highlight that we also need to give special attention in our <code>clean</code> module to how Web addresses are coming in to the system and being treated. We obviously want to maintain the original addresses as supplied by the respective external sources. We also want to test and make sure these have not been improperly encoded. And we also want to test that our canonical subset of characters used in KBpedia is being uniformly applied to our own internal addresses."

It is likely this routine is no longer needed with Python's improved handling of UTF-8.

    "Though Python routines could be written for the next points below, they may be easier to deal with directly in a spreadsheet. This is OK, since we are also at that point in our roundtripping where we are dealing directly with CSV files anyway.\n",

From there, are can readily sort for the specific input column of interest in order to inspect the entire row of values.\n",

    "Here is my checklist for such flat file inspection:\n",

    "1. Does any item in the 'id' column lack a URI fragment identifier? If so, provide using the class and property URI naming conventions in KBpedia (CamelCase in both instances, upper initial case for classes, lower initial case for properties, with only alphanumerics and underscore as allowable characters).

    "\n",
    "4. Check a few rows. Does any column entry have leading or trailing white spaces? If so, use the spreadsheet TRIM function\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Check a few rows. Do any of the files with a 'definition' column show its full text spread over more than one cell? If so, you have an upstream CSV processing issue that is splitting entries at the common or some other character that should be escaped. The best fix, if intermediate processing has not occurred, is to re-extract the file with correct CSV settings. If not, you may need to concatenate multiple cells in a row in order to re-construct the full string\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. URI fragment identifier? If so, provide using the class and property URI naming conventions in KBpedia (CamelCase in both instances, upper initial case for classes, lower initial case for properties, with only alphanumerics and underscore as allowable characters).

    "### Other Cleaning Routines\n",
    "Fortunately, in our case, we are extracting fairly simple CSV files (though often with some long text entries for definitions) and ingesting in basically the same format. As long as we are attentive to how we modify the intermediate flat files, there is not too much further room for error.\n",

    "Hadley Wickham, the noted R programmer and developer of many fine graphics programs, wrote a paper, [Tidy Data](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf), that is an excellent starting primer on wrangling flat files. In the case of our KBpedia knowledge graph and its supporting CSV, about the only guideline that he proposes that we consciously violate is to combine many-to-one data items sometimes in a single column (notable for <code>altLabels</code>, but a few others as well). According to Wickham, we should put each individual value on its own row. I have not done so to keep the listings more compact and the row count manageable. Nonetheless, his general guidance is excellent. Another useful guide is [Wrangling Messy CSV Files by Detecting Row and TypePatterns](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.11242.pdf).\n",
