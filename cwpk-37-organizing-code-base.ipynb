    "This installment begins a new major part in our [*Cooking with Python and KBpedia*](https://www.mkbergman.com/cooking-with-python-and-kbpedia/) series. Starting with the format of our extraction files, which can come directly from our prior extraction routines or from other local editing or development efforts, we are now in a position to build a working [KBpedia](https://kbpedia.org/) from scratch, and then to test it for [consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency) and [satisfiability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability). This major part, of all parts in this **CWPK** series, is the one that most closely reflects our traditional build routines of KBpedia using [Clojure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure).\n",
    "\n",
    "But this current part is also about more than completing our [roundtrip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-trip_format_conversion) back to KBpedia. For, in bringing new assignments to our knowledge graph, we must also test it to ensure it is encoded properly and that it performs as promised. These additional requirements also mean we will be developing more than a build routine module in this part. The way we are structuring this effort will also add a testing module and a cleaning module (for checking encodings and the like). There are a dozen installments, including this one, in this part to cover this ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "The addition of more modules, with the plan of still more to come thereafter, also compels us to look at how we are architecting our code and laying out our files. Thus, besides code development, we need to pay attention to organizational matters as well. "

    "<p>I am pretty pleased with how the <em>cowpoke</em> extraction module turned out, so will be following something of the same pattern to build KBpedia in this part. Since we made the early call to bootstrap our project from the small, core top-level KBpedia Knowledge Ontology (<a href=\"https://kbpedia.org/docs/kko-upper-structure/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">KKO</a>), we gained alot of simplification. That is a good trade-off, since KKO itself is a value-neutral top-level ontology built from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotic_theory_of_Charles_Sanders_Peirce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">semiotic</a> perspective of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">C.S. Peirce</a> regarding knowledge representation. Our basic design can also be adopted to any other <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_ontology\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">top-level ontology</a>. If that is your desire, how to bring in a different TLO is up to you to figure out, though I hope that would be pretty easy following the recipes in these <strong>CWPK</strong> installments.</p>\n",
    "<p>Fortunately as we make the turn to build routines in this part of the roundtrip, we are walking ground that we have been traveling for nearly a decade. We understand the build process and we understand the testing and acceptance criteria necessary to result in quality, publicly-released knowledge graphs. We try to bring these learnings to our functions in this part.</p>\n",
    "<p>But as I caution at the bottom of each of these installments, I am learning <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Python</a> myself through this process. I am by no means a knowledgeable programmer, let alone an expert. I am an interested amateur who has had the good fortune to have worked with some of the best developers imaginable, and I only hope I picked up little bits of some good things here and there about how to approach a coding project. Chances are great you can improve on the code offered. I also, unfortunately, do not have the coding experience to provide commercial-grade code. Errors that should be trapped are likely not, cases that need to be accommodated are likely missed, and generalization and code readability is likely not what it could be. I'll take that, if the result is to help others walk these paths at a better and brisker pace. Again, I hope you enjoy . . .</p>\n",
    "<h3 id=\"Organizing-Objectives\">Organizing Objectives</h3>\n",
    "<p>I have learned some common-sense lessons through the years about how to approach a software project. One of those lessons, obvious through this series itself, is captured by John Bytheway's <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/321104-inch-by-inch-life-s-a-cinch-yard-by-yard-life-s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">quote</a>, \"Inch by inch, life's a cinch. Yard by yard, life's hard.\" Knowing where you want to go and taking bite-sized chunks to get there almost always leads to some degree of success if you are willing to stick with the journey.</p>\n",
    "<p>Another lesson is to conform to community practice. In the case of Python (and most modern languages, I assume), applications need to be 'packaged' in certain ways such that they can be readily brought into the current computing environment. From the source-code perspective, this means conforming to the 'package' standard and the organization of code into importable modules. All of this suggests a code base that is kept separate from any project that uses it, and organized and packaged in a way similar to other applications in that language.</p>\n",
    "<p>An interesting lesson about knowledge graphs is that they are constantly changing -- and need to do so. In this regard, knowledge artifacts are not terribly different than software artifacts. Both need to be updated frequently such that versioning and version control are essential. Versioning tells users the basis for the artifact; version control helps to maintain the versions and track differences between releases. Wherever we decide to store our artifacts, they should be organized and packaged such that different versions may be kept integral. Thus, we organize our project results under version number labels.</p>\n",
    "<p>Then, in terms of this particular project where roundtripping is central and many outputs are driven from the KBpedia knowledge structure, I also thought it made sense to establish separate tracks between inputs (the 'build' side) and outputs (the 'extraction' side) and to seek parallelisms between the tracks where it makes sense. This informs much of the modular architecture put forward.</p>\n",
    "<p>All of this needs to be supplemented with utilities for testing, logging, error trapping and messaging, and statistics. These all occur at the time of build or use, and so belong to this leg of our roundtrip. We will not develop code for all of these aspects in this part of the <strong>CWPK</strong> series, but we will try to organize in anticipation of these requirements for a complete project. We'll fill in many of those pieces in major parts to come.</p>\n",
    "<h3 id=\"Anticipated-Directory-Structures\">Anticipated Directory Structures</h3>\n",
    "<p>These considerations lead to two different directory structures. The first is where the source code resides, and is in keeping with typical approaches to Python packages. Two modules are in-progress, at least at the design level, to complete our roundtripping per the objectives noted above. Two modules in logging and statistics are likely to get started in this current part. And another three are anticipated for efforts with KBpedia to come before we complete this <strong>CWPK</strong> series. Here is that updated directory structure, with these new modules noted in <span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">red</span>:</p>"
