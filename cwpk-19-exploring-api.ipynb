    "In our last installment of this [*Cooking with Python and\n",
    "KBpedia*](https://www.mkbergman.com/cooking-with-python-and-kbpedia/) series, we learned some KBpedia terminology and loaded the main [KBpedia](https://kbpedia.org/) knowledge graph file, <code>kbpedia_reference_concepts.owl</code>. (Remember, do **NOT** use the <code>kbpedia_reference_concepts.n3</code> since [owlready2](http://www.lesfleursdunormal.fr/static/informatique/owlready/index_en.html) does not support the [Notation3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notation3) syntax.) You will need to navigate back to that file location again. One of the aspects of working with [Jupyter Notebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter) is that, once you leave the application, you must re-load your files again whenever you return to the application. As you also recall, it is also necessary to Run the cells in order for a given notebook to restore the states that each cell needs.\n",

We will then apply these basic approaches to starting efforts to manage these ontologies, which begins with our next installment."
