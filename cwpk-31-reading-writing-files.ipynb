    "We have been opening and using files for many installments in this [*Cooking with Python and KBpedia*](https://www.mkbergman.com/cooking-with-python-and-kbpedia/) series. However, in the past few installments, our methods are also beginning to generate serious results, some of thousands of lines. It is time for us to learn the basic commands for writing and reading files. We will also weave in a new [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) import into our workspace, the [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) module. It will be important for us as we begin to import the basic [N3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notation3) and CSV files that underly [KBpedia](https://kbpedia.org/)'s build process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another point we weave through today's installment is the usefulness of following Python's lead in composing the names of our files and methods in a hierarchical and logically named way. Such patterns mean we can more readily find and save the information we want to keep persistent. This patterning, along with some directory structure guidance we will address a few installments from now, help set up a logical way to manage and utilize the information assets in KBpedia (or your own domain extensions of it). Logical organization helps in a system designed for subset selections, semantic technology analysis, and machine learning, where the system itself is built from large, external files and we roundtrip with extractions from the current state of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "But reading and writing files is not a new subject for this series. Since early with our exposure to [owlready2](http://www.lesfleursdunormal.fr/static/informatique/owlready/index_en.html) and [Jupyter Notebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter) we have been loading and inspecting parts of KBpedia.

    "### File Object and Methods\n",
    "To get started, let's first focus on the file object and the methods that may be applied to it in Python. A 'file object' has the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A physical file address, which can be referenced by a variable name\n",
    "- A stated form of text encoding, which we standardize on as [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) in KBpedia\n",
    "- A method to be used when opening, whether read or write or append or others noted below.\n",
    "\n",
    "A 'file object' is given a variable name, which in this section let's simply call <code>f</code>. Python's <code>open()</code> and <code>close()</code> methods only apply to file objects. Thus, one can not simply 'open' a physical file address without first associating that physical file to a file object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a 'file object' is defined by assigning it a variable name, besides <code>f.open()</code> and <code>f.close()</code> certain other methods may be applied to the object:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <code>f.read(size)</code> - returns the text or binary document up to the 'size' indicated, which if omitted (<code>f.read()</code>) returns the entire file\n",
    "- <code>f.readline()</code> - returns a single line from the file with a new line character (<code>\\n</code>) appended to each line\n",
    "- <code>f.write(string)</code> - writes the contents that must be a string or a string variable, and returns the number of characters in that string\n",
    "- <code>f.tell()</code> - returns an integer giving the file objectâ€™s current position in the file\n",
    "- <code>f.seek(offset, where)</code> - re-sets the file object's location by an offset where the reference point is by convention either the beginning of the file (0), the current position (1) or the end of the file (2), with 0 the default\n",
    "- <code>f.truncate()</code> - see <code>help(file)</code> below and for many other more obscure ones:"

    "A quite different but major way to get output from a Python program is the <code>print()</code> built-in function. Because it is often the first statement we learn in a language ('Hello KBpedia!'), we tend to overlook the complexity and power of this function.\n",
    "\n",
    "A <code>print()</code> statement provides two kinds of output from Python. The first is the result from an evaluated expression (or code block), say the calculation of a formula. The second kind is for strings (that is, text and written numbers), which can be manipulated in many ways. Either output type may be directed to a file object. If all of the values passed to a print function are strings (or converted to such prior), then virtually all string <code>str</code> functions are available to manipulate the entire list of value information passed to the function.\n",

Under the other options, a file can be left in an open state when a program terminates unexpectedly, possibly affecting the file integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In looking across the options above, let's make a couple of other points besides the need to specify the encoding. The first is that the file is opened by default in <code>'r'</code> read-only mode. You can see that mode specified in the <code>print</code> output even when not assigned directly. Other mode options include <code>'w'</code> when you wish to write or overwrite to the file, and <code>'a'</code> for append when you wish to add to the end of a file. Here is the complete suite of file mode options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <code>'r'</code>   - opens a file for reading only\n",
    "- <code>'r+'</code>  - opens a file for both reading and writing\n",
    "- <code>'rb'</code>  - opens a file for reading only in binary format\n",
    "- <code>'rb+'</code> - opens a file for both reading and writing in binary format\n",
    "- <code>'w'</code>   - opens a file for writing only\n",
    "- <code>'a'</code>   - open for writing; the file is created if it does not exist\n",
    "- <code>'a+'</code>  - open for reading and writing; the file is created if it does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to observe is that Python may accept more than one name alias for the encoding. Our examples above, for example, use both <code>'utf8'</code> or <code>'utf-8'</code> for the encoding argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, as I admonished early in this **CWPK** series, try to always assign logical names to your physical file paths. As I noted earlier, there are tricky ways that Windows handles file names versus other operating systems and keeping (and then testing) proper file recognition in a separate assignment means you can develop and work with your code without worrying about file locations and paths. You may also do things programmatically to update or change the file referent for these logical names such that the actual file opened may be specified to a different physical location depending on context.\n",
    "\n",
    "A last thing to notice is that things like encoding or mode need not be specified as arguments in a given method command. When a default value is given at time of definition of the method (notably something to inspect for 'built-in' Python methods such as <code>file</code>), that argument can be left off what is actually written in code, with the default assignment being used. It is thus important to understand the commands you use, the options you may assign directly as an argument assignment, and the defaults they have. Whenever you get into trouble, first try to understand the full scope of the statements and their arguments available to you using the <code>dir</code> and <code>help</code> methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proper exiting of an application or writing to file generally requires you to <code>close()</code> the files you have opened. Again, if you open with the <code>with open</code> pattern, you should generally close gracefully. Nonetheless, here is the formal command, taking advantage of the fact we gave the physical file the logical name of 'file':"

    "This brief overview points to either file object methods or the print function as two ways to get output out of your programs. Further, within each of these two major ways there are many styles and approaches that might be taken to get to your desired output goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of KBpedia where we use flat CSV files as our canonical exchange form, which are themselves by definition built from strings, we will tend to use <code>write()</code> function as our preferred way to prepare our strings for output. However, when reading the external files, we tend to use the file object read methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me offer one final note on output considerations: Since we have only a relatively few generic processing steps for either extracting or building KBpedia, but ones that repeat across multiple modules or semantic object types, we will try to find ways to compose our file names from meaningful building block elements for consistency and understandability. We will start to see this in a fragmented way initially with our function and output definitions. When we get to the project-wide considerations, though, toward the concluding installments, we will be consolidating these fragments and building block considerations in a way that hopefully makes overall sense."

    "### Using the CSV Module\n",
    "\n",
    "Though CSV files are easy to generate, manage, and inspect, and there is a formal standard with [RFC4180](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt), actual implementation is more like the Wild West. Delimiters other than commas or tabs may be used (semi-colons, etc.) to separate values. Specific purposes may add local specifications, such as the 'double pipe' ('||') convention we have adopted for multiple entries in a cell. Treatment of quoted strings, including what to quote and how to quote, may differ between applications. We have also discussed the importance of standard encodings, the failure of which to use may lead to disastrous file corruptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "CSV files in implementation have a standard layout of rows and columns, which is good, sometimes with headers and sometimes not. Though Microsoft Excel is a huge application for CSV files, Excel does not use UTF-8 as its standard and sometimes does other interesting things to its cell contents. It would be nice, for example, to have recognized templates that would enable us to move from one CSV environment to another. At minimum, we want to impose rigor and consistency to how we handle CSV files to prevent encoding mismatches or other discontinuities.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help overcome some of these challenges we are using the Python csv module. Let's first look and explore what functions this module has: "

    "Here are some of the attractive features of using the CSV module as our intermediary for data exchange. The CSV module:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses the same file object functions as standard Python, including an expanded <code>csv.reader</code> and <code>csv.writer</code>\n",
    "- Recognizes 'dialects', which are templates of processing specifications that can be defined or link to existing applications like Excel\n",
    "- Has a sniffer function to discover dialect regularities in new, wild files\n",
    "- Allows different quoting stringency levels to be set (all strings, multi-word strings, etc.)\n",
    "- Allows different delimiters to be set\n",
    "- Allows headers to be used or not\n",
    "- Recognizes field names for specific data columns\n",
    "- Enables Python dictionaries to mediate field names to master data.\n",
    "\n",

    "[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/contents.html) are additional CSV options with much more functionality should that be warranted."
