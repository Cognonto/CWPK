We have, so to speak, tossed all of the components into the bin, and have mostly defined our knowledge structure's scaffolding. But we still lack some structural definitions and analysis prior to beginning the testing for whether this structure is coherent or not. Today's installment directly addresses these gaps.\n",

With 72 items in the current typology list (excluding <code>Generals</code>, which is the catch-all combined parent), we thus have 2,556 options to test, since order is not important in the pair. The basic formula is <code>n(n-1)/2</code>. With this many comparisons, the process clearly needs to be automated. \n",

For each iteration, we will collect the RCs from the first ontology, the RCs from the second typology, convert them to sets, and then do a set intersection. We then want to print out the count of the intersections, and the actual RCs in the two typology sets that overlap if the intersection falls below a set number of overlaps.

We pull out the actual typology item by index from the tandem **(4)**, and, like before, evaluate that string to retrieve the actual typology class reference **(5)**.

This is where we can quickly compare to the output from the earlier <code>disjoint_status</code> function. Second, for intersections with minimal overlap, we want to inspect those items and discover if we can revise scope or assignments for some RCs to make the pair disjoint. This latter step is a bit tricky (aside from any misassignments, which have now been flagged for correction) because we do not want to change our ideas of 'natural' classes merely to make a disjoint assertion. However, sometimes either the scope of the typology, or the scope of the shared RC, may be tweaked such that a defensible disjoint status may be asserted. When there are very few overlaps, for example, one approach that has sometimes made sense is to move a concept into a parent category above the two comparison child typologies. There are also circumstances where the overlap is real, and even if only with a few overlap items, the non-disjointedness should be maintained (and thus no changes should be made).\n",

    "#### Duplicates in the Parental Chain\n",
    "Our last structural utility at this juncture is one that analyzes whether a given reference concept (RC) is only assigned once to its lowest logical occurrence in a parental inheritance chain. While there is nothing illogical about assigning a concept wherever it is subsumed by a parent, multiple assignments for a single RC in a given inheritance chain lead to unreadability and difficulties in maintaining the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we know that a 'polar bear' is a 'bear', which is a 'mammal' that is part of 'Eutheria', all of which are 'LivingThings'. There is nothing logically wrong with assigning the 'polar bear' concept to all of these other items. Inferencing would show 'polar bear' to be a subclass of all of these items. However, redundant assignments act to clog our listing, and makes it difficult to know when we see an occurrence whether it is at its terminal node location or not. We get cleaner ontologies that are easier to maintain by trying to adhere to the best practice of a single assignment to an inheritance chain, best placed at its lowest hierarchical level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Redundant assignments, in my view, are all too common with most knowledge graphs. I like the analytical routine below since it helps me to pare down to the essence of the logic of the ontology structure. Code notes are discussed below the listing:"
