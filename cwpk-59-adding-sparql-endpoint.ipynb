    "Sometimes the installments in this [*Cooking with Python and KBpedia*](https://www.mkbergman.com/cooking-with-python-and-kbpedia/) series come together fairly quickly, sometimes not. This installment has proven to be particularly difficult. Research has spread over days, and progress has been frustratingly slow. As a result, I spread the content of developing a remote SPARQL service across two parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the outset I thought it would progress rapidly: After all, is not [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL) a proven query language with central importance to [knowledge graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph)? But, possibly because our focus in the series is [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)), or perhaps for other reasons, I have found a dearth of examples to follow regarding setting up a Python endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will recall we first introduced SPARQL in [**CWPK #25**](https://www.mkbergman.com/2358/cwpk-25-querying-kbpedia-with-sparql/) in conjunction with the [RDFLib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFLib) package. We showed the flexibility and robustness of this query language to retrieve and filter any and all structural aspects of a knowledge graph. Then, in installment [**CWPK #50**](https://www.mkbergman.com/2396/cwpk-50-querying-external-sources/) we expanded on this basis to describe how SPARQL can be an essential component for querying and retrieving data from external sources, principally [Wikidata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikidata) and [DBpedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBpedia).\n",
    "\n",
    "Most all public SPARQL endpoints that presently exist (see [this representative list](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Lists/SPARQL_endpoints), which is disappointingly small) are based on [triple stores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore) that [come bundled with SPARQL endpoints](https://www.w3.org/wiki/LargeTripleStores). A few are also based on endpoint wrappers based on Java such as [RDF4j](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDF4J) or [Jena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jena_(framework)) and a few languages such as C ([Redland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redland_RDF_Application_Framework)) or [JavaScript](https://www.w3.org/community/rdfjs/wiki/Comparison_of_RDFJS_libraries). These options obviously do not meet our Python objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in [**CWPK #25**](https://www.mkbergman.com/2358/cwpk-25-querying-kbpedia-with-sparql/), RDFLib provides SPARQL query support and also has the related [SPARQLwrapper](https://rdflib.dev/sparqlwrapper/) package that enables one to pose queries to external SPARQL endpoints. ([easysparql](https://github.com/oeg-upm/easysparql) provides similar functionality.) However, the objective we have to turn a local or remote instance into a SPARQL-enabled endpoint accessible to outside parties is not so easily supported. A number of years back there were the well-regarded [rdflib-web](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib-web) apps that ran within [Flask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flask_(web_framework)); unfortunately, this code is out of date and does not run on Python 3. There was also the [adhs](https://github.com/nareike/adhs) package that saw limited development and has not been updated in five years. In my initial diligence for this series I also found the [pyLDAPI](https://pyldapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package that looked promising. However, I have not been able to find a working version of this system, and the I find the approach it takes to [content negotiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_negotiation) for [linked data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data) to be cumbersome and tedious (see next installment).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, based on the fragments indicated and found from these researches, I decided to tackle setting up a SPARQL endpoint largely on my own. Having established a toe-hold in our remote Linux server in the last installation, I decided to proceed by baby steps reflecting what I had already learned with our local instance to expose an endpoint on our remote server."

Flask maps Web (HTTP) requests to Python functions, which we showed in the last installment where the <code>/sparql</code> URI fragment maps to the <code>/var/www/html/sparql</code> path and its <code>test_sparql.py</code> function. Flask runs this code and then displays results to the browser using HTTP protocols, with the <code>GET</code> method being the most common, but all HTTP methods may be supported. The Python code invoked may call up templates (based on Jinja) that can then invoke HTML pages forms and various response functions. \n",

While neither appears to have a working example, both contain aspects that can inform this task and subsequent ones. A (non-working) implementation of pyLDAPI called [GNAF](https://github.com/CSIRO-enviro-informatics/gnaf-dataset/blob/master/view/templates/page_sparql.html), in particular, has a SPARQL Web page that looked to be useful as a starting template.\n",

Besides embedding standard HTML, these templates may also contain set Flask statements that relate the Web page to various model or controller commands. These templates should be placed into a set directory under the Flask directory structure. The templates can be nested within one another, useful, for example, when one wants a header and footer repeated across multiple pages, but for our instance I chose a single-page template.\n",

These queries, whether samples or ones of your own crafting, can be pasted into the query entry box **(3)**. Once pasted, you have the option to enter an external SPARQL query URL **(4)**, pick whether your query should be directed internally to KBpedia or externally **(4)** (if the query is external), and to select amongst about 8 output formats **(4)**, including standard RDF/XML, JSON, CSV, HTML, etc. Then, when you submit the query **(4)**, the results appear in the final text box **(5)**. If the results are helpful, you may copy them and paste them into a local file.\n",
