This completion will set the template for how we will add additional clusters of functionality as we progress through the **CWPK** series. \n",

    "The new extraction routine is geared more to later analysis and use of [KBpedia](https://kbpedia.org/) than our current extraction routines. The routines we have developed so far are intended for nearly complete bulk extractions of KBpedia. We would like to add more fine-grained ways to extract various 'slices' from KBpedia, especially those that may arise from individual typology changes or [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL) queries. We could benefit from having an intermediate specification for extractions that could be used for directing results from other functions or analyses."

    "### Steps to Package a Project so Far\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, here are the major steps we have discovered so far to transition from prototype code in the notebook to a Python package:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generalize the prototype routines in the notebook\n",
    "1. Find the appropriate <code>.. Lib/site-packages</code> directory and define a new directory with your package name, short lowercase best\n",
    "1. Create an <code>\\_\\_init\\_\\_.py</code> file in that same directory (and any subsequent sub-package directories should you define the project deeper); add basic statements similar to above\n",
    "1. Create a <code>\\_\\_main\\_\\_.py</code> file for your shared functions; it is a toss-up whether shared variables should also go here or in <code>\\_\\_init\\_\\_.py</code>\n",
    "1. If you want a single point of editing for changing inputs for a given run via a 'record' metaphor, follow something akin to what I began with the <code>config.py</code>\n",
    "1. Create a <code>my_new_functions.py</code> module where the bulk of your new work resides (extraction in our current instance). The approach I found helpful was to ***NOT*** wrap my prototype functions in a function definition at first. Only in the next step, once the interpreter is able to step through the new functions without errors, do I then wrap the  routines in definitions\n",
    "1. In an interactive environment (such as Jupyter Notebook), start with a clean kernel and try to <code>import myproject</code> (where 'myproject' is the current bundle of functionality you are working on). Remember, an import will run the scripts as encountered, and if you have points of failure due to undefined variables or whatever, the traceback on the interpreter will tell you what the problem is and offer some brief diagnostics. Repeat until the new function code processes without error, then wrap in a definition, and move on to the next code block\n",
    "1. As defined functions are built, try to look for generalities of function and specification and desired inputs and outputs. These provide the grist for continued re-factoring of your code\n",
    "1. Document your code, which is only just beginning for this KBpedia project. I've been documenting much in the notebook pages, but not yet enough in the code itself."

    "### Objectives for This Installment\n",
    "Here is what I want to accomplish and wrap up in this installment focusing on custom extractions. I want to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Arbitrarily select one to many classes or properties for driving an extraction\n",
    "- Define one or multiple starting points for descendants() or one or multiple individual starting points. This entry point is provided by the variable <code>root</code> in our existing extraction routines\n",
    "- Allow the <code>extract_deck</code> specification to also define the rendering method (see next)\n",
    "- For iterations, specify input and output file forms, so need: iterator, base + extention logic, relate to existing annotations, etc., as necessary\n",
    "- This suggests to reuse and build from the existing extraction routines, and\n",

    "You may recall from the tip in [**CWPK #29**](https://www.mkbergman.com/2364/cwpk-29-extracting-object-and-data-properties/) that [owlready2](http://www.lesfleursdunormal.fr/static/informatique/owlready/index_en.html) comes with three rendering methods for its results: 1) a *default* method that has a short namespace prefix appended to all classes and properties; 2) a *label* method where no prefixes are provided; and 3) a full *iri* method where all three components of the *subject-predicate-object* (*s-p-o*) [semantic triple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_triple) are given their complete [IRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_Resource_Identifier).

    "### A Custom Extractor\n",

But, fortunately, apparently our existing routines already are sufficiently general to enable this customization.\n",

    "\n",
    "What now makes this routine (**#2**) a custom one is the use of the configurable <code>custom_dict</code> and its configuration settings. The <code>custom_dict</code> dictionary is specified by assigning to the <code>loop_list</code> (**#3**). The <code>custom_dict</code> dictionary can take one or many *key:value* pairs. The first item, the *key*, should take the name that you wish to use as the internal variable name. The second item, the *value*, should correspond to the property or class with its namespace prefix. Here are the general rules and options available for a custom extraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You may enter properties **OR** classes into the <code>custom_dict</code> dictionary, but not both, in your pre-run configurations\n",
    "- The '<code>iri</code>' switch for the renderer is best suited for the <code>struct_extractor</code> function. It should probably not be used for annotations given the large number of output columns and loss of subsequent readability when using the full IRI. The choice of actual prefix is likely not that important since it is easy to do global search-and-replaces when in bulk mode\n",
    "- You may retrieve items in the <code>custom_dict</code> dictionary either singly or all of its descendants, depending on the use of the 'single' and 'descent' keyword options (see **#4** next). \n",

    "Item **#4** is another switch to either run the entries in the <code>custom_dict</code> dictionary as single 'roots' (thus no sub-classes or sub-properties) or with all descendants. The <code>descent_type</code> has been added to the <code>extract_deck</code> settings, plus we added the related assignments to the beginning of this code block.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last generalized capability we wanted to capture was the ability to print out all of the structural aspects of KBpedia's typologies, which suggested some code changes at roughly **#5** above. While I am sure I could have figured out a way to do this, because of interactions with the other customizations this addition proved to be more complicated than warranted. So, rather than spend undue time trying to cram everything into a single, generic function (<code>struct_extractor</code>), I decided the easier and quicker choice was to create its own function, picking up on many of the processing constructs developed for the other extractor routines.\n",

    "- The <code>\\_\\_init\\_\\_.py</code> file that indicates the *cowpoke* package\n",
    "- The <code>\\_\\_main\\_\\_.py</code> file where shared start-up functions reside\n",
    "- The <code>config.py</code> file where we store our dictionaries and where we specify new run settings in the special <code>run_deck</code> dictionary, and\n",
    "- The <code>extract.py</code> module where all of our extraction routines are housed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This module is supported by three dictionaries (and the fourth special one for the run configurations):\n",

    "- The <code>typol_dict</code> dictionary of typologies\n",
    "- The <code>prop_dict</code> dictionary of top-level property roots\n",
    "- The <code>custom_dict</code> dictionary for tailored starting point extractions, and\n",
    "- The <code>extract_deck</code> special dictionary for extraction run settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In turn, most of these dictionaries can also be matched with three different extractor routines or functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The <code>annot_extractor</code> function for extracting annotations\n",
    "- The <code>struct_extractor</code> function for extracting the *is-a* relations in KBpedia, and\n",
    "- The <code>typol_extractor</code> dedicated function for extracting out the individual typologies into individiual files.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our next **CWPK** installment we will discuss how we might manipulate this extracted information in a bulk manner using spreadsheets and other tools. These same extracted files, perhaps after bulk manipulations or other edits and changes, will then form the basis for the input files that we will use to build new versions of KBpedia (or your own extensions and changes to it) from scratch. We are now half-way around our [roundtrip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-trip_format_conversion).\n",
