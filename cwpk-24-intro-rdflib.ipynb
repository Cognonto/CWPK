    "In [<strong>CWPK #17</strong>](https://www.mkbergman.com/2347/cwpk-17-choosing-and-installing-an-owl-api/) of this [*Cooking with Python and KBpedia*](https://www.mkbergman.com/cooking-with-python-and-kbpedia/) series, we discussed what we would need in an [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) to [OWL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language). Our work so far with [owlready2](http://www.lesfleursdunormal.fr/static/informatique/owlready/index_en.html) continues to be positive, leading us to believe it will prove out in the end to be the right API solution for our objectives. But in that same <strong>CWPK #17</strong> review we also indicated intrigue with the [RDFLib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFLib) option. We know there are some soft spots with [owlready2](http://www.lesfleursdunormal.fr/static/informatique/owlready/index_en.html) in areas such as format support for which RDFLib is strong. It is also the case that owlready2 lacks a [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL) query option, another area in which RDFLib is strong. In fact, the data exchange methods we use in [KBpedia](https://kbpedia.org/) rely directly on simple variants of [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework), especially in the [N3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notation3) notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In recognition of these synergies, just has it had in embracing [SQLite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite) as a lightweight native quad store, owlready2 has put in place many direct relations to RDFLib, including in the data store. What I had feared would be a difficult challenge of integrating [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)), [Anaconda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaconda_(Python_distribution)), [Jupyter Notebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter), owlready2, and RDFLib, turned out in fact to be a very smooth process. We introduce the newest RDFLib piece in today's installment.\n",
    "\n",
    "RDFLib is a Python library for interacting with the Resource Description Framework (RDF) language. It has been actively maintained over 15 years and is presently in version 5.x. RDFLib is particularly strong in the areas of RDF format support, SPARQL querying of endpoints (including local stores), and [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) file functionality. Our hope in incorporating RDFLib is to provide the most robust RDF/OWL platform available in Python."

    "### Installing RDFLib\n",

    "<code>$ conda install rdflib</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see the standard feedback to the terminal that the package is being downloaded and then integrated with the other packages in the system. The simple install command is possible because we had already installed <code>conda-forge</code> as a channel within the Anaconda distribution system for Python as described in [**CWPK #9**](https://www.mkbergman.com/2336/cwpk-9-installing-python/).\n",
