    "In our last coding installments in this [*Cooking with Python and KBpedia*](https://www.mkbergman.com/cooking-with-python-and-kbpedia/) series, prior to our single-installment detour to learn about files, we developed extraction routines for both structure (<code>rdfs:subClassOf</code>) and annotations (of various properties) using the fantastic package [owlready2](https://owlready2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html). In practice, these generic routines will loop over populations of certain object types in [KBpedia](https://kbpedia.org/), such as typologies or property types. We want a way to feed these variations to the generic routines in an efficient and understandable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) lists are one way to do so, and we have begun to gain a bit of experience in our prior work with lists and sets. But there is another structure in Python called a 'dictionary' that sets up [key-value pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute%E2%80%93value_pair) of 2-[tuples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple) that promises more flexibility and power. The 2-tuple sets up a relationship between an attribute name (a variable name) with a value, quite similar to the [associative arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array) in [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON). The values in a dictionary can be any object in Python, including functions or other dictionaries, the latter which allows 'record'-like data structures. However, there may not be duplicate names for keys within a given dictionary (but names may be used again in other dictionaries without global reference).\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries (<code>'dicts'</code>) are like Python lists except list elements are accessed by their position in the list using a numeric index, while we access <code>dict</code> elements via keys. This makes tracing the code easier. We have also indicated that dictionary structures may be forthcoming in other uses of KBpedia, such as [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) or [master data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_data). So, I decided to start gaining experience with <code>'dicts'</code> in this installment.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Other apparent advantages of dictionaries not directly related to our immediate needs include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dictionaries can be expanded without altering what is already there\n",
    "- From Python 3.7 onward, the order entered into a dict is preserved in loops\n",
    "- Dictionaries can handle extremely large data sets\n",
    "- <code>Dicts</code> are fast because they are implemented as a [hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table), and \n",
    "- They can be directly related to a [Pandas DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) should we go that route.)\n",

    "### The Basic Iteration Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "In installments [**CWPK #28**](https://www.mkbergman.com/2363/cwpk-28-extracting-structure-for-typologies/), [**CWPK #29**](https://www.mkbergman.com/2364/cwpk-29-extracting-object-and-data-properties/), and [**CWPK #30**](https://www.mkbergman.com/2365/cwpk-30-extracting-annotations/), we created generic prototype routines for extracting structure from typologies and properties and then annotations from classes (including typologies as a subset) and properties as well. We thus have generic extraction routines for:\n",
    "\n",
    "|  Structure                     | Annotations            |\n",
    "|:---------                      |:-----------            |\n",
    "| classes                        | classes                |\n",
    "| typologies &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  | typologies (possible)  |\n",
    "| properties                     | properties             |\n",
    "\n",
    "Our basic iteration approach, then, is to define dictionaries for the root objects in these categories and loop over them invoking these generic routines. In the process we want to write out results for each iteration, provide some progress messages, and then complete the looping elements for each root object. Labels and internal lookups to the namespace objects come from the dictionary. In generic terms, then, here is how we want these methods to be structured:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initialize method\n",
    "- Message: starting method\n",
    "- Get <code>dict</code> iterator:\n",
    "  - Message: iterating current element\n",
    "  - Get owlready2 set iterator for element:\n",
    "    - Populate row\n",
    "    - Print to file\n",
    "- Return to prompt without error message.    "
