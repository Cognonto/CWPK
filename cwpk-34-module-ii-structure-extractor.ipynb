    "This installment of the [*Cooking with Python and KBpedia*](https://www.mkbergman.com/cooking-with-python-and-kbpedia/) series is the second of a three-part mini-series on writing and packaging a formal Python project. The previous installment described a [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) (don't repeat yourself) approach to how to generalize our annotation extraction routine. This installment describes how to transition that code from [Jupyter Notebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter#Jupyter_Notebook) interactive code to a formally organized Python package. We also extend our generalized approach to the structure extractor. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this installment I am working with the notebook and the [Spyder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyder_(software)) IDE in tandem. The notebook is the source of the initial prototype code. It is also the testbed for seeing if the package may be imported and is working properly. We use Spyder for all of the final code development, including moving into functions and classes and organizing by files. We also start to learn some of its [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) features, such as auto-complete, which is a nice way to test questions about namespaces and local and global variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted in earlier installments, a Python 'module' is a single script file (in the form of <code>my_file.py</code>) that itself may contain multiple functions, variable declarations, class (object) definitions, and the like, kept in this single file because of their related functionality. A 'package' in Python is a directory with at least one module and (generally) a standard <code>\\_\\_init\\_\\_.py</code> file that informs Python a package is available and its name. Python packages and modules are named with lower case. A package name is best when short and without underscores. A module may use underscores to better convey its purpose, such as <code>do_something.py</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our project based on _Cooking with Python and KBpedia_ (**CWPK**), we will pick up on this acronym and name our project '*cowpoke*'. The functional module we are starting the project with is <code>extract.py</code>, the module for the extraction routines we have been developing over the past few installments.."

    "### Perplexing Questions\n",
    "While it is true the Python organization has some thorough tutorials, referenced in the concluding **Additional Documentation**, I found it surprisingly difficult to figure out how to move my [Jupyter Notebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter#Jupyter_Notebook) prototypes to a packaged [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) program. I could see that logical modules (single Python scripts, <code>\\*.py</code>) made sense, and that there were going to be shared functions across those modules. I could also see that I wanted to use a standard set of variable descriptions in order to specify 'record-like' inputs to the routines. My hope was to segregate all of the input information required for a new major exercise of *cowpoke* into the editing of a single file. That would make configuring a new run a simple process.\n",
    "\n",
    "I read and tried many tutorials trying to figure out an architecture and design for this packaging. I found the tutorials helpful at a broad, structural level of what goes into a package and how to refer and import other parts, but the nuances of where and how to use classes and functions and how to best share some variables and specifications across modules remained opaque to me. Here are some of the questions and answers I needed to discover before I could make progress:\n",
    "\n",
    "***1. Where do I put the files to be seen by the notebook and the project?***\n",
    "\n",
    "After installing Python and setting up the environment noted in installments [**CWPK #9**](https://www.mkbergman.com/2336/cwpk-9-installing-python/) - [**#11**](https://www.mkbergman.com/2338/cwpk-11-installing-a-python-ide/) you should have many packages already on your system, including for Spyder and Jupyter Notebook. There are at least two listings of full packages in different locations. To re-discover what your Python paths are, Run this cell:"

   "source": [
    "You want to find the site packages directory under your Python library (mine is <code>C:\\\\1-PythonProjects\\\\Python\\\\lib\\\\site-packages</code>). We will define the '*cowpoke*' directory under this parent and also point our Spyder project to it. (**NB:** Of course, you can locate your package directory anywhere you want, but you would need to add that location to your path as well, and later configuration steps may also require customization.)\n",
    "\n",
    "***2. What is the role of class and defined variables?***\n",
    "\n",
    "I know the major functions I have been prototyping, such as the annotation extractor from the last [**CWPK #33**](https://www.mkbergman.com/2370/cwpk-33-a-python-package-part-i-the-annotation-extractor/) installment, need to be formalized as a defined function (the <code>def *function_name*</code> statement). Going into this packaging, however, it is not clear to me whether I should package multiple function definitions under one class (some tutorials seem to so suggest) or where and how I need to declare variables such as *loop* that are part of a run configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "One advantage of putting both variables and functions under a single class is that they can be handled as a unit. On the other hand, having a separate class of only input variables seems to be the best arrangement for a record orientation (see next question #4). In practice, I chose to embrace both types.\n",
    "\n",
    "***3. What is the role of <code>self</code> and where to introduce or use?***\n",
    "\n",
    "The question of the role of <code>self</code> perplexed me for some time. On the one hand, <code>self</code> is not a reserved keyword in Python, but it is used frequently by convention. Class variables come in two flavors. One flavor is when the variable value is universal to all instances of class. Every instance of this class will share the same value for this variable. It is declared simply after first defining the class and outside of any methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>variable = my_variable</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, instance variables, which is where <code>self</code> is used, are variables with values specific to each instance of class. The values of one instance typically vary from the values of another instance. Class instance variables should be declared within a method, often with this kind of form, as this example from the **Additional Documentation** shows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "class SomeClass:\n",
    "    variable_1 = “ This is a class variable”\n",
    "    variable_2 = 100    #this is also a class variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, param1, param2):\n",
    "        self.instance_var1 = param1\n",
    "        #instance_var1 is a instance variable\n",
    "\tself.instance_var2 = param2   \n",
    "        #instance_var2 is a instance variable\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this recipe, we are assigning <code>self</code> by convention to the first parameter of the function (method). We can then access the values of the instance variable as declared in the definition via the <code>self</code> convention, also without the need to pass additional arguments or parameters, making for simpler use and declarations. (**NB:** You may name this first parameter something other than <code>self</code>, but that is likely confusing since it goes against the convention.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, know we may use this same approach to assign <code>self</code> as the first parameter for instance methods, in addition to instance variables. For either instance variables or methods, Python explicitly passes the current instance and its arguments (<code>self</code>) as the first argument to the instance call.\n",
    "\n",
    "At any rate, for our interest of being able to pass variable assignments from a separate <code>config.py</code> file to a local extraction routine, the approach using the universal class variable is the right form. But, is it the best form?\n",
    "\n",
    "***4. What is the best practice for initializing a record?***\n",
    "\n",
    "If one stands back and thinks about what we are trying to do with our annotation extraction routine (as with other build or extraction steps), we see that we are trying to set a number of key parameters for what data we use and what branches we take during the routine. These parameters are, in effect, keywords used in the routines, the specific values of which (sources of data, what to loop over, etc.) vary by the specific instance of the extraction or build run we are currently invoking. This set-up sounds very much like a kind of 'record' format where we have certain method fields (such as output file or source of the looping data) that vary by run. This is equivalent to a *key:value* pair. In other words, we can treat our configuration specification as the input to a given run of the annotation extractor as a dictionary (<code>dict</code>) as we discussed in the last installment. The <code>dict</code> form looks to be the best form for our objective. We'll see this use below.\n",
    "\n",
    "***5. What are the special privileges about <code>\\_\\_main\\_\\_.py</code>?***\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing I saw while reading the background tutorials was reference to a more-or-less standard <code>\\_\\_main.\\_\\_.py</code> file. However, in looking at many of the packages installed in my current Python installation I saw that this construct is by no means universally used, though some packages do. Should I be using this format or not?\n",
    "\n",
    "For two reasons my general desire is to remove this file. The first reason is because this file can be confused with the <code>\\_\\_main\\_\\_</code> module. The second reason is because I could find no real clear guidance about best practices for the file except to keep it simple. That seemed to me thin gruel for keeping something I did not fully understand and found confusing. So, I initially decided not to use this form.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I found things broke when I tried to remove it. I assume with greater knowledge or more experience I might find the compelling recipe for simplifying this file away. But, it is easier to keep it and move on rather than get stuck on a question not central to our project. \n",
    "\n",
    "***6. What is the best practice for arranging internal imports across a project?***\n",
    "\n",
    "I think one of the reasons I did not see a simple answer to the above question is the fact I have not yet fully understood the relationships between global and local variables and module functions and inheritance, all of which require a sort of grokking, I suppose, of namespaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "I plan to continue to return to these questions as I learn more with subsequent installments and code development. If I encounter new insights or better ways to do things, my current intent is to return to any prior installments, leave the existing text as is, and then add annotations as to what I learned. If you have not seen any of these notices by now, I guess I have not later discovered better approaches. (**Note**: I think I began to get a better understanding about namespaces on the return leg of our build 'roundtrip', roughly about **CWPK #40** from now, but I still have questions, even from that later vantage point.)"
