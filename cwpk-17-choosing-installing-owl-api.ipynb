    "<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.mkbergman.com/2327/cwpk-2-what-to-expect/\"><strong>CWPK #2</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.mkbergman.com/2329/cwpk-4-the-baseline-architecture/\"><strong>#4</strong></a> installments to this <a href=\"https://www.mkbergman.com/cooking-with-python-and-kbpedia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Cooking with Python and KBpedia</em></a> series, we noted that we would reach a decision point when we needed to determine how we will manipulate our knowledge graphs (ontologies) using the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Python</a> language. We have now reached that point. Our basic Python environment is set (at least in an initial specification) and we need to begin inputting and accessing <a href=\"https://kbpedia.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">KBpedia</a> to develop and test our needed management and build functions.</p>\n",
    "<p>In our own efforts over the past five years or more, we have used the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Java</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/owlcs/owlapi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OWL API</a> initially developed by the University of Manchester. The OWL API is an integral part of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prot%C3%A9g%C3%A9_%28software%29\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Prot&eacute;g&eacute;</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IDE</a> (see <a href=\"https://www.mkbergman.com/2331/cwpk-5-overview-and-installation-of-protege/\"><strong>CWPK #5</strong></a>) and supports <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OWL2</a>. The API is actively maintained. We have been very pleased with the API's performance and stability in our earlier KBpedia (and other ontology) efforts. In our own <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Clojure</a>-based work we have used a wrapper around the OWL API. A wrapper using Python is certainly a viable (perhaps even best) approach to our current project.</p>\n",
    "<p>We still may return to this approach for reasons of performance or capabilities, but I decided to first explore a more direct approach using a Python language option. This decision is in keeping with this series' Python education objectives. I prefer for these lessons to use a consistent Python style and naming conventions, rather than those in Java. I was also curious to evaluate and test what presently exists in the marketplace. We may gain some advantages from a more direct approach; we may also discover some gotchas or deadends that initial due diligence missed. We can always return to Plan B with a wrapper around the existing OWL API.</p>\n",
    "<p>If we do need to revert and take the wrapper approach, the leading candidate for the wrapper is <a href=\"https://www.py4j.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">py4j</a>. Initial research suggests other Python bridges to Java such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jython\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jython</a> or <a href=\"https://jpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">JPype</a> are less efficient and less popular than py4j. <a href=\"https://pyjnius.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pyJNIus</a> had a similar objective to py4j but has seen no development activity for 4-6 years. The <a href=\"http://robot.obolibrary.org/\">ROBOT</a> tool for biomedical ontologies points the way to how Python can <a href=\"https://robot.obolibrary.org/python\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">link through py4j</a>. Even if our Python-based approach herein works great, we still may want to embrace py4j as we move forward given the wealth of ontology-related applications written in Java. But I digress.</p>\n",
    "<p>There is no acclaimed direct competitor to the OWL API in Python, though there are pieces that may approximate its capabilities. Frankly, I was surprised after beginning my due diligence with the relative dearth of Python tools for working with OWL. Many of the Python projects that do or did exist harken back years. There was a bulge of tool-making in the mid-2000s using Python that has since cooled substantially, with two notable exceptions I discuss below.</p>\n",
    "<p>One of those exceptions is <a href=\"https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RDFLib</a>, a Python library for working with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RDF</a>. RDFLib provides a useful set of parsers and serializers and a plug-in architecture, but directly lacks OWL 2 support. <a href=\"https://github.com/RDFLib/FuXi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FuXi</a> was an OWL reasoner based on RDFLib that used a subset of OWL, but is now abandoned. <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://packages.python.org/SuRF/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SuRF</a> is an object-RDF mapper based on RDFlib that enables manipulations of RDF triples, but is somewhat dated. <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://github.com/cosminbasca/rdftools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rdftools</a> had a similar objective to RDFLib, but has been abandoned from about 5-7 yrs ago. <a href=\"https://pydoc.net/owllib/0.1.0/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">owlib</a> is a 5-yr old API to OWL built using RDFLib to simplify working with OWL constructs; it has not been updated and is inactive. More currently, <a href=\"https://rdflib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/apidocs/rdflib.extras.html#module-rdflib.extras.infixowl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">infixowl</a> is a RDFLib Python binding for the OWL abstract syntax, which makes it more like the wrapper alternative. Though not immediately applicable to our OWL needs, we may later embrace RDFLib for parsers and serializers or as a useful library for the typologies in KBpedia.</p>\n",
    "<p>Then there are a number of tools independent of RDFLib. <a href=\"http://seth-scripting.sourceforge.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SETH</a> was an attempt at a Python OWL API that still required the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine\">JVM</a> from about a dozen years back, and is now largely abandoned (though available via <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/seth-scripting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CVS repository</a>). <a href=\"https://github.com/hsolbrig/funowl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">funowl</a> is a pythonic API that follows the OWL functional model for constructing OWL and it provides a <a href=\"https://www.py4j.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">py4j</a> or equivalent wrapper to the standard Java OWL libraries. It appears to be active and is worth keeping an eye on. The <a href=\"https://github.com/biolink/ontobio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ontobio</a> Python module is a library for working with ontologies and associations to outside entities, though it is not an ontology manager.</p>\n",
    "<p>Fortunately, the second exception is <a href=\"http://www.lesfleursdunormal.fr/static/informatique/owlready/index_en.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">owlready2</a>, a module for ontology-oriented programming in Python 3, including an optimized RDF quadstore. A number of things impressed me about owlready2 in my due diligence. First, its functionality fit the bill for what I wanted to see in an ontology manager dealing with all <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CRUD</a> (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">create-read-update-delete</span>) aspects of an ontology and its components. Second, I liked the intent and philosophy behind the system as expressed in its original academic paper and home Web site (see <strong>Additional Documentation</strong> below). Third, the project is being actively maintained with many releases over the past two years. Fourth, the documentation level was comparatively high for an open-source project and clearly written and understandable. And, last, there is an <a href=\"https://github.com/dwintergruen/Owlready-rdflib\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">existing extension</a> to owlready2 that adds support for RDFLib, should we also decide to add that route.</p>\n",
    "<p>One concern arising from my diligence is the lack of direct Notation3 (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notation3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">N3</a>) file support in owlready2, since all of KBpedia's current ontology files are in N3. According to owlready2's developer, Jean-Baptiste Lamy, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Triples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">N-Triples</a>, which are a subset of N3, are presently supported by owlready2. We can test and see if our N3 constructs load or not. If they do not, we can save out our ontology files in RDF/XML, which owlready2 does support. (Indeed, use of the RDF/XML format has proven to be the better approach.) Alternatively, we can do file conversions with RDFLib or the Java OWL API. File format conversions and compatibility will be a constant theme in our work, and this potential hurdle is not unlike others we may face.</p>\n",
    "<p>Thus, while the pickings were surprisingly thin for off-the-shelf OWL tools in Python, owlready2 appears to have the requisite functionality and currentness and to be a reasonable initial choice. Should this choice prove frustrating, we will likely fall back onto the py4j wrapper to the OWL API or funowl.</p>\n",
    "<p>So, now with the choice made, it is time to set up our directory structure and install owlready2.</p>\n",
    "<p>Here is our standard main directory structure with the owlready2 additions noted:</p>\n",
    "<pre>|-- PythonProject                                             \n",

    "</pre>\n",

    "<p>Let's begin working with <code>owlready2</code> by loading and reading an ontology/knowledge graph file.

    "<p>As you begin to work with files in Python on Windows, here are some initial considerations:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>In Windows, a full file directory path starts with a drive letter (<code>C:, D:</code>. etc.). In Linux and OS-X, it starts with \"<code>/</code>\"</li>\n",
    "<li>Python lets you use OS-X/Linux style slashes \"<code>/</code>\" in Windows. Recommended is to use a format such as '<code>C:/Main/FirstDirectory/second-directory/my-file.txt</code>'</li>\n",
    "<li>Relative addressing is allowed, with the current directory understood to be the one where you started your interpreter (Jupyter Notebook in our case). However, that is generally not best practice. Python embraces the concept of Current Working Directory. CWD is the folder your Python is operating from, which might vary by application, such as Jupyter Notebook. The CWD is the <code>'root</code>' for your current session. What this means is that relative file addresses can be tricky to use. You are best off using the absolute reference to all of your files.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p>When you work with online file documents, you will need to use different Python commands and conventions, as the examples below show. We will offer more explanation on this specific option when the code below is presented.</p>\n",
