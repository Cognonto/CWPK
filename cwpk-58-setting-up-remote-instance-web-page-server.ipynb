    "Today's installment in our [*Cooking with Python and KBpedia*](https://www.mkbergman.com/cooking-with-python-and-kbpedia/) series begins a three-part mini-series of moving our environment into the clouds. This first part begins with setting up a remote instance and Web page server using the mini-framework [Flask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flask_(web_framework)). The next installment expands on this basis to begin adding a [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL) [endpoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_endpoint) to the remote instance. And, then, in the concluding third part to this mini-series, we complete the endpoint and make the SPARQL service active.\n",
    "\n",
    "We undertake this mini-series because we want to make KBpedia more open to SPARQL queries from anywhere on the Web and we will be migrating our main KBpedia Web site content to Python. The three installments in this mini-series pave the way for us to achieve these aims.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin today's installment by looking at the approach and alternatives for achieving these aims, and then we proceed to outline the steps needed to set up a Python instance on a remote (cloud) instance and to begin serving Web pages."

    "### Approach and Alternatives\n",
    "We saw earlier in [**CWPK #25**](https://www.mkbergman.com/2358/cwpk-25-querying-kbpedia-with-sparql/) and [**CWPK #50**](https://www.mkbergman.com/2396/cwpk-50-querying-external-sources/) the usefulness of the SPARQL query language to interact with knowledge graphs. Our first objective, therefore, was to establish a similar facility for KBpedia. Though we have an alternate choice to set up some form of [RESTful API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) to KBpedia (see further **Additional Documentation** below), and perhaps that may make sense at some point in time, our preference is to use SPARQL given its robustness and many query examples as earlier installments document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, we can foresee that our work with Python in KBpedia may warrant our moving our standard KBpedia Web site to that away from Clojure and its current Bootstrap-based Web page format. Though Python is not generally known for its Web-page serving capabilities, some exploration of that area may indicate whether we may go in that direction or not. Lastly, given our intent to make querying of KBpedia more broadly available, we also wanted to adhere to [linked data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data) standards. This latter objective is perhaps the most problematic of our aims as we will discuss in a couple of installments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, and certainly the easiest path, when one wants to set up a SPARQL endpoint with linked data '[conneg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_negotiation)' (content negotiation) is to use an existing [triple store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore) that has these capabilities built in. We already use [Virtuoso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuoso_Universal_Server) as a triple store, and there are a couple of Python [installation](https://www.openlinksw.com/blog/~kidehen/?id=1651) [guides](https://github.com/cltl/PythonVirtuosoInterface) already available for Virtuoso. Most of the other widely available triple stores have similar capabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Were we not interested in general Web page serving and were outside of the bounds of the objectives of this **CWPK** series, use of a triple store is the path we would recommend. However, since our aims are different, we needed to turn our attention to Python-based solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the standpoint of Web-page serving, perhaps the best known and most widely installed Python option is [Django](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_(web_framework)), a fully featured, open-source [Web framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_content_management_systems). Django has a similar scope and suite of capabilities to its PHP counterpart, [Drupal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drupal). These are comprehensive and complicated frameworks, well suited to massive database-backed sites or ones with e-commerce or other specialty applications. We have had much experience with Drupal, and frankly did not want to tackle the complexity of a full framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "I was much more attracted to a simpler [microframework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microframework). The two leading Python options are Flask and [Bottle](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/faq.html#common-problems-and-pitfalls) (though there is also [Falcon](https://falcon.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), which does not seem as developed). I was frankly more impressed with the documentation and growth and acceptance shown by Flask, and there appeared to be more analogous installations. Flask is based on the [Jinja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinja_(template_engine)) template engine and the [Werkzeug](https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/) [WSGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface) (Web-server Gateway Interface) utility library. It is fully based on Unicode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another factor that needs to be considered is support for [RDFlib](https://github.com/RDFLib) the key package (and related) that we will be using for the SPARQL efforts. I first discussed this package in [**CWPK #24**](https://www.mkbergman.com/2357/cwpk-24-introduction-to-rdflib/), though it is featured in many installments."

    "### Basic Installation\n",
    "We will be setting up these new endpoints on our cloud server, which is a large [EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/index.html?nc2=h_ql_doc_ec2) instance on [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) running [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](https://ubuntu.com/blog/tag/ubuntu-18-04). Of course, this is only one of many cloud services. As a result, I will not discuss all of the preliminary steps to first securing an instance, or setting up an [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) client to access it, nor any of the initial other start-up issues. For EC2 on AWS, there are many such tutorials. Two that I have encountered in doing the research for this installment include [this one](https://ketakirk.wordpress.com/deploy-an-app-on-aws/) and [this other one](https://towardsdatascience.com/deploying-a-python-web-app-on-aws-57ed772b2319). There are multiple others, and ones applicable to other providers than AWS as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we begin from the point that an instance exists and you know how to log in and do basic steps with it. Even with this simplification, I began my considerations with these questions in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Do I need a package manager, and if so, which one?\n",
    "1. Where should I place my Python projects within the remote instance directory structure?\n",
    "1. How do I also include the pip package environment?\n",
    "1. Should I use virtual environments?\n",
    "\n",
    "With regard to the first question, I was sure I wanted to maintain the [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) package manager, but I was not convinced I needed the full GUI and set of packages with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual/get-started). I wanted to keep consistency with the set-up environment we put in place for our local instance (see [**CWPK #9**](https://www.mkbergman.com/2336/cwpk-9-installing-python/)). However, since I had gained much experience with Anaconda and conda, I felt comfortable not installing the full 4 GB full Anaconda distribution. This led me to adopt the minimal [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) package, which has a much smaller footprint. True, I will need to install all specific Python packages and work from the command line (terminal), but that is easy given the experience I have gained.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, in reviewing best practices information for directory structures on Ubuntu, I decided to create an analogous 'python-projects' master directory, similar to what I established for the local instance, under the standard user application directory. I thus decided and created this master directory: <code>usr/bin/python-projects</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, having decided to use miniconda and knowing the master directory I wanted to use, I proceeded to begin to set up my remote installation. I followed a [useful source](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-python-3-and-set-up-a-programming-environment-on-an-ubuntu-18-04-server) for this process, though importantly updated all references to the current versions. The first step was to navigate to my master directory and then to download the 64-bit Linux installer onto my remove instance, followed by executing the installation script:"

The last step in the installation process asks where you want Miniconda installed. The default is to use <code>root/miniconda3</code>. Since I wanted to keep all of my Python project stuff isolated, I overrode this suggestion and used my standard location of <code>/usr/bin/python-projects/miniconda3</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "After all of the appropriate files are copied, I agreed to initialize Miniconda. This completes the basic Miniconda installation.\n",

    "  </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "After signing back in, I again navigated to my Python master directory and then installed the [pip package manager](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) since not all of the Python packages we use in this **CWPK** series and *cowpoke* are available through conda."

    "### Virtual Environments and a Detour\n",
    "In the standard use of a Linux installation, one uses the distro's own installation and package management procedures. In the case of Ubuntu and related distros such as Debian, <code>apt</code> stands for '[advanced package tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software))' and through commands such as <code>apt-get</code> is one means to install new capabilities to your remote instance. Other Linux distros may use [<code>yum</code>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yum_(software)) or [<code>rpm</code>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager) or similar to install new packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, of course, within Python, one has the [<code>pip</code>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_(package_manager)) package installer and the <code>conda</code> one we are using. Further, within a Linux installation, how one may install packages and where they may be applicable depends on the user rights of the installer. That is one reason why it is important to have [<code>sudo</code>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo) (super user) rights as an administrator of the instance when one wants new packages to be available to all users.\n",
    "\n",
    "These package managers may conflict in rights and, if not used properly, may act to work at cross purposes. For example, in a standard AWS EC2 instance using Ubuntu, it comes packaged with its own Python version. This default is useful for the occasional app that needs Python, but does not conform to the segregation of packages that Python often requires using its '[virtual environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_environment_software)'. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the face of it, the use of virtual environments seems to make sense for Python: we can keep projects separate with different dependencies and even different versions of Python. I took this viewpoint at face value when I began this transition to installing Python on a remote instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this, it is important to never run <code>sudo pip install</code>. We need to know where and to what our Python packages apply, and generic (Linux-type) install routines confuse Linux conventions with Python ones. We are best in being explicit. There are conditions, then, where the idea of a Python virtual environment makes sense. These circumstances include, among others, a Python shop that has many projects; multiple developers with different versions and different applications; a mix of Python applications between Python 2 and 3 or where specific version dependencies create unworking conditions; and so forth. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, what I found in migrating to a remote instance is that virtual environments, combined with a remote instance and different operating system, added complexity that made finding and correcting problems difficult. After struggling for hours trying to get systems to work, not really knowing where the problem was occurring nor where to look for diagnostics, I learned some important things the hard way. I describe below some of these lessons."

In general, these approaches used <code>virtualenv</code> (or <code>venv</code>), a pip-based environment manager, to set up this environment. Further, since I was using Ubuntu, AWS and Apache2, these aspects added to the constraints I needed to accommodate to pursue this path.\n",
