    "We Continue the Theme of Structural Extraction\n",

    "\n",
    "In this installment of the [*Cooking with Python and KBpedia*](https://www.mkbergman.com/cooking-with-python-and-kbpedia/) series, we continue the theme of extracting the structural backbone to [KBpedia](https://kbpedia.org/). Our attention shifts now from classes to properties, the predicates found in the middle of a *subject - predicate - object* [semantic triple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_triple). A *s-p-o* triple is the basic assertion in the [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) and [OWL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language) languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of predicate properties in OWL. [Object properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-primer-20121211/) relate a subject to another named entity, one which may be found at an [IRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_Resource_Identifier) address, local or on the Web. [Data properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-primer-20121211/) are a value characterization of the subject, and may be represented by strings (labels or text) or date, time, location, or numeric values. Data properties are represented by [datatypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type), not IRIs. [Annotation properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-primer-20121211/) are pointers or descriptors to the subject and may be either a datatype or an IRI, but there is no reasoning over annotations across subjects. All property types can be represented in hierarchies using a <code>subPropertyOf</code> predicate similar to <code>subClassOf</code> for classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, KBpedia uses a triadic split of predicates based on the [universal categories](V) of [Charles Sanders Peirce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce). These map fairly closely with the OWL splits, but with some minor differences (not important to our current processing tasks). *Representations* are pointers, indicators, or descriptors to the thing at hand, the subject. These map closely to the OWL annotation properties. *Attributes* are the characterizations of the subject, intensional in nature, and are predominantly data properties (though it is not a violation to assign object properties where a value is one of an enumerated list). *Direct relations* are extensional relations between two entities, where the object in *s-p-o* must be an object property, represented by an IRI.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most of today's practice <code>subPropertyOf</code> is little used, though KBpedia is becoming active in exploring this area. In terms of semantic inheritance, properties are classes, though with important distinctions. Object and data properties may have functional roles, restrictions as to the size and nature of their sets, and specifications as to what types of subject they may represent (<code>domain</code>) or what type of object they may connect (<code>range</code>).\n",
    "\n",
    "Though supporting these restrictions, [Owlready2](http://www.lesfleursdunormal.fr/static/informatique/owlready/index_en.html) has less robust support for properties than classes. In the last installment's work on the class backbone we saw the advantage of the <code>.descendant()</code> method for collecting children or grandchildren throughout the subsumption tree of class descent. Owlready2 does not document or expose this method for properties, but with properties a sub-class of class in the Owlready2 code, I found I could use many of the class methods. Woohoo!\n",
    "\n",
    "What I outline below is a parallel structure extraction to what we saw in the last installment regarding classes. In the next installment we will transition from structure extraction to annotation extraction."

    "Since I like keeping the core ontology design idea, I will continue to use this more specific way to set the roots for KBpedia properties for these extraction routines. It adds a few more files to process down the road, but it can all be automated and I am better able to keep the distnction between KKO and the specific classes and properties that populate it for the domain at hand. It does mean that all new properties introduced to the system must be made a <code>rdfs:subPropertyOf</code> of one of the tie-in roots, but that also enforces the explicit treatment of new properties in relation to the Peircean universal categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under this approach, the root for annotation properties is <code>kko.representations</code> as noted. For object properties, the root is <code>kko.predicateProperties</code>. (The other two main branches are <code>kko.mappingProeperties</code> and <code>skos.skosProperties</code>, which we consider central to KKO.)
