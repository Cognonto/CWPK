    "\n",
    "The last structural step in a build is to test the knowledge graph for logic, the topic of today's [*Cooking with Python and KBpedia*](https://www.mkbergman.com/cooking-with-python-and-kbpedia/) installment. We first introduced the concepts of [consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency) and [satisfiability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability) in [**CWPK #26**](https://www.mkbergman.com/2360/cwpk-26-introduction-to-knowledge-graph-reasoners/). [Axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom) are assertions in an ontology, as informed by its base language; that is, the aggregate of the [triple statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_triple) in a knowledge graph. Consistency is where no stated axiom entails a contradiction, either in semantic or syntactic terms. A consistent knowledge graph is one where its model has an interpretation under which all formulas in the theory are true. Satisfiability means that it is possible to find an interpretation (model) that makes the axiom true. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Satisfiability* is a test of *classes* to discover if there is an interpretation that is non-empty. This is tested against all of the logical axioms in the current knowledge graph, most effectively driven by disjoint and functional assertions. *Consistency* is an *ontology* measure to test whether there is a model that meets all axioms. I often use the term *incoherent* to refer to an ontology that has unsatisfiable assertions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sattler, Stevens, and Lord reference shown under the first link under **Additional Documentation** below offers this helpful shorthand:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Unsatisfiable*: How ever hard you try, you will never find an individual which fits an unsatisfiable concept\n",
    "- *Incoherent*: Sooner or later, you are going to contradict yourself, and\n",
    "- *Inconsistent*: At least, one of the things you have said makes no sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [Protégé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prot%C3%A9g%C3%A9_(software)) [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment), unsatisfiable classes are shown in red in the inferred class hierarchy, and makes them subclasses of Nothing, meaning they have no instances, ever. If the ontology is inconsistent, it is indicated by a new window warning about the inconsistency and offering guidance of how to fix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two reasoners available to us, via either [owlready2](http://www.lesfleursdunormal.fr/static/informatique/owlready/index_en.html) or Protégé, are [HermiT](http://www.hermit-reasoner.com/) and [Pellet](https://github.com/stardog-union/pellet). Hermit is better at identifying *inconsistencies*, while Pellet is better at identifying *unsatisfiable* classes. We will use both in our structural logic tests.\n",

    "However, before we get into those logic topics, we need to load up our system with our new start-up routines."

Assign <code>domain</code> and <code>range</code> to all <code>objectProperties</code> and <code>dataProperties</code>, but also be relaxed in the assignments to account for the diversity of data characterizations in the wild.
