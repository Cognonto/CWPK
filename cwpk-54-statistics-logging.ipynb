    "This installment in our [*Cooking with Python and KBpedia*](https://www.mkbergman.com/cooking-with-python-and-kbpedia/) series covers two useful (essential?) utilities for any substantial project: <code>stats</code> and <code>logging</code>. <code>stats</code> refers to internal program or knowledge graph metrics, not a generalized statistical analysis package. <code>logging</code> is a longstanding Python module that provides persistence and superior control over using simple <code>print</code> statements for program tracing and debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the stats side, we will emphasize capturing metrics not already available when using [Protégé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prot%C3%A9g%C3%A9_(software)), which provides its own set of useful baseline statistics. (See *Figure 1*.) These metrics are mostly simple counts, with some sums and averages. The results of these metrics are some of the numerical data points that we will use in the next installment on charting.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the logging front, we will edit all of our existing routines to log to file, as well as print to screen. We can embed these routines in existing functions so that we may better track our efforts."

    "### Logging\n",
    "I think an honest appraisal may straddle the fence about whether logging makes sense for the *cowpoke* package. On the one hand, we have begun to assemble a fair degree of code within the package, that perhaps would normally trigger the advisability of logging. On the other hand, we run the various scripts only sporadically, and in pieces when we do. There is not a continuous production function under what we have done, so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to introduce this code into a production setting or get multiple developers involved, I would definitely argue for the need for logging. Consider what we have in the current *cowpoke* code base as the transition condition for looking at this question. However, since logging is good practice, and we are close, let's go ahead and invoke the capability nonetheless.\n",

    "The <code>logging</code> module that comes with Python is quite mature and has further advantages:\n",

    "2. We can format the messages as we wish, and\n",
    "3. We can send our messages to file, screen, or socket.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the Python <code>logging</code> module has five pre-set warning levels:\n",

    "- *info* - confirmation that things are working as expected\n",
    "- *warning* - an indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g. ‘disk space low’). The software is still working as expected\n",
    "- *error* - due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function, or\n",
    "- *critical* - a serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.\n",

    "Logging is organized as a tree, with the root being the system level. For a single package, it is best to set up a separate main logging branch under the root so that warnings and loggings can be treated consistently throughout the package. This design, for example, allows warning messages and logging levels to be set with a single call across the entire package (sub-branches may have their own conditions). This is what is called adding a 'custom' logger to your system. \n",

    "You can set up logging messages to go to console (screen) or file. In our examples below, we will do both.\n",

    "##### Formatters\n",
    "You can set up how your messages are formatted. We can also format console v file messages differently, as our examples below show.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Default Messages\n",
    "Whenever we insert a logging message, beside setting severity level, we may also assign a message unique to that part of the code. However, if we choose not to assign a new, specific message, the message invoked will be the default one defined in our configuration."
